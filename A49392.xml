            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Iac.</hi> upon not guiltie pleaded a ſpecial verdict was found to this effect: that <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> was ſeiſed in fee, in right of her Crown of the late Prebends of <hi>Sutton Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Horton,</hi> and <hi>Hordley</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Buck,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the place where &amp;c. is parcel, and ſhe <hi>20 Februarie 11.

E. 4.6.</hi> and <hi>Plowden</hi> in the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſters</hi> caſe, for as it is there ſaid, it agrees with the Majeſtie of the King to have a record of things

                        </note> or to him, and if a grant is pleaded to be made to the King, it is good to ſay <hi>quod non habetur tale Recordum,</hi> and here is no record, but a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum</hi> made upon it, for otherwiſe leaſes made by Abbots before the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be ſaid to be of record, becauſe after the diſſolution they were all put in the Tower amongſt the records, but queſtionleſs thoſe leaſes are not of record, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not any <hi>Memorandum</hi> made upon them: alſo in the <hi>Lord Latimers caſe 12. H. 7.</hi> in <hi>Kelloway,</hi> where Baron and feme ſeiſed in right of the feme in fee granted to the King, this is not good if the deed be not inrolled, for there they of the other ſide would have concluded the Tenant to ſay the contrary, but that the deed was inrolled, and ſo by way of admittance confeſs that a grant to the King is not good, if the deed be not inrolled: <hi>3. Eliz. Dyer</hi> the <hi>Lord Dacres</hi> ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a patent of an office granted to him before Sir <hi>Nicholas Hare Maſter</hi> of the Rolls, but the ſurrender was not recorded, nor the patent Cancelled, nor a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat</hi> entred upon the inrolment, this is void, and ſhall not be aided now after the death of Sir <hi>Nicholas Hare per optimam opinionem;</hi> in <hi>Kemps caſe Dyer 195.</hi> but it will be ſaid that it appears not there, that the ſurrender was made in Chancery, and therefore differs from our caſe; but ſee <hi>19. Eliz. Dyer 355.</hi> which is direct in the point, where an exchange of land was with <hi>E. 6.</hi> by deed acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be inrolled &amp;c. but not inrolled, it cannot after nor be inrolled, nor veſt any intereſt in the Queen either as heir, or Purchaſor, ſo hereby it appears that before inrolment, an eſtate veſts not in the King, and he ſaid that he had heard <hi>Popham</hi> late chief Iuſtice ſay, that the opinion of the Iudges was, that in this caſe nothing veſts in the King until inrolment, and for that there was a private Act made in <hi>39. Eliz.</hi> to relieve this particular caſe, ſo the <hi>Memorandum</hi> makes the record, and not the delivery of the patent to be cancelled, but the opinion of <hi>Davers</hi> in <hi>37. H. 6.10.</hi> may be objected againſt me, where he ſaith, that if a man make a feofment to the King, and deliver the deed in the Exchequer, or at the Kings Coffers, it is good without inrolment, which by the Court is intended for goods, and not to a feofment made to the King, for this is only the opinion of <hi>Davers,</hi> which I denie to be law, and alſo all this may be admitted for law, and yet prove nothing, for when the partie ſurrenders to the King, and delivers the deed to be inrolled, ſo that he had done all which in him is to paſs the land to the King, then it may aptly be ſaid in common ſpeech, that the right of the land is in the King: becauſe he of right ought to have it after inrolment, although he had not the propertie of the land before the Deed be inrolled, then if nothing veſt in the Queen in the principal caſe before the patent made in <hi>37. Eliz.</hi> the words ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent in the patent will not help the matter, <hi>viz. quam quidem ſurſum redditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem acceptamus per praeſentes,</hi> becauſe the King had taken nothing before, and the recital in the patent concludes not the Queen; it hath been ſaid that the not making of a <hi>Memorandum</hi> is the fault of the Clark, and this ſhall not prejudice the partie in ſo great a miſchief, but I anſwer that the ſame miſchief will inſue, where a man ſells land by indenture, and delivers it to the Clark to be inrolled, and he inrols it not within <hi>6.</hi> moneths, nothing ſhall paſs by the ſale, yet this is only the fáult of the Clark, but in this caſe he may have his action upon the caſe againſt the Clark, if ſo it be that he had paid all his fees, the fame law in the principal caſe, but admitting that, yet great miſchief will inſue if it be ſo that the eſtate ſhall paſs to the King before inrolment, for then the eſtate and intereſt ſhall be tried by the Countrie, and not by the record, and then alſo in what place ſhould a man ſearch to finde the Kings eſtate, and perhaps for want of knowledge thereof every grant of the King will be avoided, and this would be a great miſchief to the ſubjects, but admitting that this ſhould be a good ſurrender without a <hi>Memorandum,</hi> or <hi>Vacat,</hi> yet this is not ſhewed in this caſe, for it appears not here that his intent was to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render it, for although he deliver up his Letters patents, yet his eſtate remaines; and then the conſideration of the patent in <hi>37. Eliz.</hi> being of a ſurrender of the firſt patent, and alſo of a ſurrender of the eſtate, if the eſtate be not ſurrendred as well
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97330:4"/>as the patent, the conſideration is for that falſe, and then the patent is void, and to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ove that the eſtate remains although that the patent be ſurrendred, it appears by <hi>Fiſher 12.

Eliz. 195.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond point admitting that there is no actual ſurrender, if notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, the Patent of <hi>37. Eliz.</hi> be good, and as to that, I ſay if this Patent be good, it is becauſe the Queen had recited the particular eſtate; and therefore is not to her damage, or becauſe the ſecond Patent is a ſurrender in law of the firſt, and the rather becauſe it appears to be the intention of the Queen, that the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhould be a ſurrender by theſe words, <hi>quam quidem ſurſum redditionem ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptamus per praeſentes;</hi> and as to the firſt reaſon it ſeems to me, that the Queen recites this as a particular eſtate determined, and not as an eſtate continuing, for by theſe words <hi>modo habens et gaudens</hi> it appears that the meaning of the Queen was, that the <hi>Lord Seymor</hi> had not an eſtate continuing in the intent of the Queen at the time of the making of the ſecond Patent, but the <hi>Lord Chandos caſe</hi> in <hi>Coo. 6. fol. 55.</hi> ſeems to impugne me in this opinion, where the King made a gift in tail, and afterward by Patent reciting the former Grant, and alſo that the Patentee had delivered up the Patent into the Chancerie to be cancelled, by vertue whereof he thought himſelf to be ſeiſed in demeaſne as of fee, did grant the lands unto the ſaid Donee in fee, in that caſe it was adjudged that the reverſion did paſs unto the Donee, although the words of the reverſion were not contained in the Patent: although that the King in that caſe did think that he granted a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſeſſion, but the reaſon of that was, that although the Patent was not inrolled, yet by law it ſhould have been ſurrendred unto the King, nevertheleſs becauſe that was the collection of the King, and not the ſuggeſtion of the partie that the King was ſeiſed by vertue &amp;c. therefore the collection being falſe ſhall not make the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent void, for all there that came of the ſuggeſtion of the partie is true, but our caſe is otherwiſe, for here the intention of the King was, that he had the land in poſſeſſion when he had made the grant, and in truth he had but a reverſion: alſo if the Patent ſhould be good, great prejudice would or might enſue to the Queen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, for put the caſe that the Queen had annexed a condition to this leaſe, or that ſhe had reſerved a greater rent upon it, this condition, or increaſing of the rent was the cauſe that the Queen had made this grant, and that if the ſecond grant ſhould be good, and the firſt not determined, that the Grantee may claim his firſt eſtate, and ſo defeat the Queen of her rent, and of his condition to have benefit of either, and this was the reaſon why the Patent was adjudged void in the caſe of <hi>Barwick Coo. lib. 5. fo. 94.</hi> becauſe ſome parcels were not ſurrendred to the Queen, and therefore they were not ſubject to conditions, or rent reſerved upon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97330:5"/>the ſecond Patent: and for a ſecond reaſon he argued that the acceptance of the ſecond Patent is not a ſurrender in Law of the firſt Patent, becauſe the firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is meerly void, as it appears in <hi>Fulmerſton</hi> and <hi>Stewards caſe Plowden 107.</hi> that the reaſon why the taking of a ſecond leaſe ſhall be a ſurrender of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is, becauſe both the eſtates cannot be in one and the ſame Parſon at one and the ſame time, but this reaſon holds not in our caſe, becauſe no eſtate paſſeth by the ſecond Patent in regard it is void, and therefore this caſe may be reſembled unto the laſt caſe in <hi>23. Eliz. Dyer,</hi> where a man taking a ſecond benefice incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible without diſpenſation, doth not make the firſt benefice void by the Statute againſt Pluralities, becauſe he never was a lawful Parſon of the ſecond benefice in reſpect the never ſubſcribed to the Articles according to <hi>13. Eliz. cap. 12.</hi> and in <hi>Harries</hi> and <hi>Wings caſe</hi> the ſecond Patent was void: but a third reaſon was, he thought that theſe words <hi>Quam quidem ſurſum redditionem acceptamus</hi> have not aided this Grant, for the ſecond Patent is made in conſideration of a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der made by the Patentee, and therefore there ought to be a good ſurrender made by him, or otherwiſe the conſideration is falſe, for the King in conſideration of a ſurrender made doth grant lands where in <hi>facto</hi> there was no ſurrender, as if the King grant black acre in conſideration of a ſurrender of white acre, which in <hi>facto</hi> was not done, this grant is void: alſo this appears by theſe words <hi>modo habens et gaudens ſurſum reddidit et reſtituit &amp;c.</hi> that the intention of the Queen was, that the <hi>Lord Seymor</hi> had ſurrendred before, and that he had no eſtate at this time of the making of the grant, for theſe words <hi>modo habens et gaudens</hi> ought to be interpreted according to the rules of Grammar, and for that in <hi>9. H. 7.16. b.</hi> the Court conſulted with Grammarians touching the expoſition of Latine words and was by them directed, and he ſaid that this word <hi>modo</hi> had divers ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for this ſignifieth <hi>nuper, interdum, aliquando,</hi> but moſt properly it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>nuper, or interdum, modo Paratus e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

H. 4.</hi> that this is not in him before agreement and entrie, and <hi>32.

<list>
                           <item>Firſt, whether here be an actual ſurrender found to be made in Law.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, if the acceptance of the ſecond leaſe be good, or if the Queen reciting the eſtate, and that he had ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred which the Queen had accepted, and that in conſideration thereof ſhe made the Grant, whether this be made good although there be no actual ſurrender.</item>
                           <item>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, admit that here he no actual ſurrender in <hi>facto,</hi> whether this grant be aided by the Statute of <hi>43. Eliz. cap. 1.</hi> but firſt before he would enter into his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſaid that he would waſh away the Rubs caſt in his way to make his way the ſmoother, and firſt where it hath been ſaid, that if the Queen ſhould take by contract, or bargain without record that great miſchief would inſue, for by that means the Queens title ſhould be tried by the Countrie: and in proof thereof he cited the <hi>Lord Latimers caſe</hi> in <hi>12. H. 7.10, 11.</hi> which he thought to be no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97330:5"/>for that purpoſe, for there the opinion of the Court was delivered concerning the ſhewing forth of Letters Patents, but not concerning matter of inrolment, alſo the caſe was of an eſtate of inheritance to be conveyed from the King, but the caſe now in queſtion is but for an eſtate for life, which may in law more eaſily be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined than an eſtate of inheritance conveyed: alſo the caſe of <hi>19. Eliz. Dyer 335.</hi> cited of the other part proves not this caſe, for firſt the queſtion was not there whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King took any thing without inrolment, but whether the Deed may be inrolled in the time of another King.</item>
                        </list> Secondly, if this be confeſſed that the King there ſhould take nothing without inrolment, yet this is not like to our caſe, for here this is but to merge a particular eſtate which differs much from the caſe of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an inheritance: alſo this is confeſſed if there had been a <hi>Memorandum</hi> made in the Margent, then the ſurrender had been good: and the want thereof is the laches of the Clark, and then if it ſhould not be a ſurrender before the <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum</hi> made, the Clark ſhould make the ſurrender, and not the partie: and as to the Book of <hi>37. H. 6.</hi> it is not anſwered, for to ſay, that the King hath no right to the thing granted before inrolment, but that he hath the propertie, that cannot be: and to that which hath been objected, that there doth not appear any intention of the ſurrender, becauſe that although the Patents are ſurrendred, the eſtate remained, the Book of <hi>32. E. 3.</hi> Monſtrance of faith <hi>178.</hi> proveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for there it is ſaid, that a man may plead, that a Dean and Chapter did not leaſe <hi>modo et forma</hi> without ſhewing any Deed, for there this pleading is not to deveſt any thing out of &amp;c. and alſo it appears in the principal caſe, that his intent was to ſurrender, for the Iury do finde that the Letters Patents were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by the command of the <hi>Lord Seymor</hi> to be cancelled: and to that which hath been objected, if the ſecond Patent ſhould be good; that the Queen might loſe her Rent, or condition, becauſe the firſt leaſe hath his continuance; to that I give anſwer, that the firſt leaſe hath not his continuance, and therefore no loſs can grow to the Queen: and to that which hath been objected, that the Queen is deceived, it appears by theſe words <hi>modo habens &amp;c. reſtituit &amp;c.</hi> that the intention of the Queen was, that the Lord <hi>Seymor</hi> had ſurrendred his eſtate before, and that he now had nothing, becauſe that the word <hi>modo</hi> being joyned with the word <hi>reddidit</hi> ſignifieth the time paſt, but as to that it ſeems to me, that although <hi>(modo) poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica licentia</hi> in the ſtrict conſtruction of Grammer may ſignifie the time paſt, yet the ſignification thereof ſhall not be ſo taken in the letters Patents, for there it ſhall be taken in common conſtruction, and not to the deceipt of the King, and therefore in the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Briſtols caſe 7. E. 6. Dyer</hi> the words are <hi>nuper in Tenura I. <hi>S.</hi> et modo in Tenura A. B.</hi> there <hi>nuper</hi> is taken for the time paſt, but <hi>modo</hi> for the preſent time: and in <hi>11. H. 7. Rogerum Towneſend modo militem</hi> is to be intended that he is now Knight, and not that he was a Knight in time paſt, and not now; alſo it is ſo to be obſerved here, that theſe words <hi>(habens et gaudens)</hi> are annexed to this word <hi>modo,</hi> both which are in the preſent time, and <hi>reſtituit</hi> comes afterwards, and ſo <hi>modo</hi> is not annexed to <hi>reſtituit,</hi> but unto <hi>habens et gaudens,</hi> alſo although the word ſhall be referred unto <hi>reſtituit,</hi> yet all may well ſtand together, for <hi>reſtituit</hi> may be referred unto the time preſent, as <hi>ſiquae fuerint</hi> in <hi>35. H. 6.11.</hi> and to that which hath been objected, that until the Queen agrees unto the ſurrender, the eſtate is not in the Queen, he thought that where Tenant for life ſurrenders before agreement, he in the reverſion is Tenant to the <hi>Praecipe,</hi> although he ſhall not maintain a Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs before entrie, for by <hi>21. H. 7.12.</hi> it appeareth that an eſtate for life may be determined aſwel by word as by ſurrender, ſo in <hi>9. H. 7.</hi> where the Tenant dies without heir, the freehold is immediately in the Lord, but yet he ſhall not have an action of Treſpas before entrie: now as to the firſt point he conceived it to be an actual ſurrender although there be no <hi>Vacat</hi> made, nor any <hi>Memorandum,</hi> and to examine it he did relate what Acts might make a ſurrender, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he ſaid, that words being uſed which do prove an aſſent of the Tenant, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97330:6"/>he in reverſion ſhall have an eſtate, that ſhall be a ſurrender without expreſs words of a ſurrender, for a man may ſurrender by theſe words <hi>Remiſit,</hi> or reſignavit, for the words are not material, if ſo there be ſubſtance, as in <hi>40.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97330:7"/>to a common intent, and therefore where the partie hath done that in him lieth, but ſome thing is to the perfection of a ſurrender, that is aided by the Statute: alſo by this word aſſurance in the Statute a purchaſe without deed is not aided, by a good aſſurance a ſurrender without deed is aided within the Statute, or elſe the Statute ſhould ſerve for little or nothing, the Statute of confirmations of letters Patents hath the ſame words. That the Statute of <hi>43. Eliz.</hi> hath, and upon <hi>18. Eliz.</hi> it was reſolved in <hi>27.</hi> of <hi>Eliz. in Huſſeys caſe,</hi> that if Tenant in tail be and the reverſion is granted to Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> this is good, and aided by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, ſo if a man grant lands to the King, but the Deed is not inrolled, this alſo is aided by the Statute, and where a grant ſhall be good at the Common Law by a Commonperſon, there the like grant made by the King is made good by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and there was a caſe in the <hi>Dutchy Chamber Trin. 37. Eliz.</hi> between <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendiſh</hi> and <hi>Bateman,</hi> where the Queen did grant Turbary within the Mannor of <hi>Lady Meadows</hi> within the Countie of <hi>Darby</hi> unto <hi>Bateman</hi> for <hi>21. years, Bateman</hi> thereof makes a meadow, and afterwards the Queen in conſideration of the ſurrender of the firſt grant, doth grant the ſame unto him for <hi>40.</hi> years by the name of a meadow, and although he made no ſurrender, yet by the taking of the grant it was reſolved that it was a good ſurrender, becauſe there it was but of a particular eſtate, but otherwiſe if ſhould be of fee, for a fee cannot be ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by implication: <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Serjeant of the King, argued that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant is guiltie of intruſion: and he divided the caſe into two parts only, the firſt whether there be a ſufficient conſideration at the Common Law, to make the ſecond Patent void, the ſecond point admitting that there is not a ſufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration by the rule of the Common Law, whether the defect thereof be aided by the Statute of <hi>43. Eliz.</hi> and he argued that the ſurrender, which the Queen inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be the conſideration of the grant, was an actual ſurrender alreadie perfected before the grant, which doth plainly appear to be ſo as he took it by the word <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum redditionem,</hi> and he ſaid that he could not ſo have that word in the Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Tenſe, as it would be ſupplied by an act of the Preſent Tente as is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſurrender is to be made by the acceptance of a new grant: and he vouched <hi>35. H. 6.</hi> alſo he thought her to intend an actual ſurrender for an other reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> for the words <hi>nobis ſurſum reddidit et reſtituit cancellandum,</hi> the which cannot be performed without an actual ſurrender, for otherwiſe there is no reſtoring: and he vouched <hi>18. Eliz. fo. 437. &amp; 43. E. 3. fo. 19.</hi> where it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that if a wife do not remain with an Adulterer with her own accord &amp;c. ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, the Queen did intend an actual ſurrender, becauſe of the words <hi>(ea intentione)</hi> which implie a ſurrender to have been actually precedent; another reaſon was for that hereby the acceptance of the ſecond Patent there is no ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wrought of the former eſtate in the Law, until after the acceptance of the ſecond letters Patents, and ſo the Queen deceived in the time: and he vouched the caſe of <hi>Totnes in 40. Eliz.</hi> in the Kings Bench, and <hi>Savages caſe in 9. H. 8. Carrels Rep. fo. 195.</hi> and here it appeareth, there was no ſurrender upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord precedent unto the ſecond grant: alſo it ought to have been found by a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al verdict. that the ſecond letters Patents were granted at the ſuit of <hi>Seymor,</hi> or otherwiſe the granting of them to him makes no ſurrender of his former letters Patents, and then it follows that they are not ſurrendred yet. And where it hath been objected that the Queen uſeth theſe words in the ſecond letters Patents, <hi>quas quidem litteras patentes praedictus Seymor modo habens et gaudens,</hi> and therefore it muſt be intended ſhe takes notice that the firſt letters Patents were not yet ſurrendred, for then ſhe would not ſay <hi>(modo habens et gaudens)</hi> he anſwered that this word <hi>modo</hi> ſignifieth the time paſſed, or the time preſently for to paſs, and the word <hi>habens</hi> cannot be taken in a legal ſenſe, no otherwiſe then the word being is taken in <hi>Dockwrais caſe, 27. H. 8. fo. 19.</hi> and ſo theſe words <hi>modo habens et gaudens,</hi> ſignifie no more but that one he had an eſtate; alſo the Queen is deceived in this word <hi>acceptamus,</hi> for ſhe cannot in the Law be ſaid to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97330:7"/>accept of that which by the Law is not veſted in her: alſo he ſaid that an actual ſurrender ought to be an actual giving up of ſo much as the Patentees received of her grant, as it appears <hi>14.

Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er 195.</hi> and he ſaid that the ſurrender which the Queen intended, ought to paſs an eſtate from the partie ſurrendring which is not ſo done here: and where it hath been objected that the very delivery in the Court made of the letters Patents is a ſurrender of them, by the opinion of <hi>Davers in 37. H. 6. fo. 10.</hi> he ſaid that this book was no Law as it may appear <hi>12. H. 7. fo. 12. Carrels Reports:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in that book alſo <hi>Vavaſour</hi> agreeth with <hi>Davers:</hi> and where it hath been objected that here is an actual ſurrender made, yet the intention of the Queen ought to be obſerved to make it an effectual ſurrender, or otherwiſe though ſhe hath no loſs by the ſurrender that is made, yet is it no effectual ſurrender, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>18. Eliz. Dyer 352..</hi> and ſo alſo was the caſe of the <hi>Iſle of Man:</hi> alſo Sir <hi>Henry Seymor</hi> did not in this caſe all that he might have done for the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this ſurrender, for he ought to have ſeen this his ſurrender recorded, as it appears by the book caſe of the <hi>11. H. 4.</hi> where it appeareth that if I be bound to levie a fine I ought to ſue forth a writ of covenant or <hi>dedimus poteſtatem,</hi> and do all ſuch other acts as it may make it a good and perfect fine in Law. Secondly, he took it that the Statute of <hi>43. Eliz.</hi> did no whit aid this caſe, for that makes no ſurrender to the Queen to be a good ſurrender, but only an actual ſurrender which here is wanting, and the Statute in no ſort extendeth to a ſurrender in the Law, for the ſurrender which this Statute intendeth to aid, ought to be a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conveying and aſſuring &amp;c. and this ſurrender in the law conveyeth nothing but only extinguiſheth, and for that purpoſe he put this caſe, if <hi>A.</hi> take a new leaſe of the Queen in <hi>27.</hi> by indenture and this is of his own land, this Statute of <hi>43. Eliz.</hi> doth not make ſuch a kind of conveyance in the Law, by Eſtoppel good to veſt the land in the Queen by this Eſtoppel which is a conveyance in the Law, unto the which the Lord chief Baron <hi>Tanfield</hi> ſaid, inſiſt not upon a labour of that kinde for it is plain enough, becauſe the Queen being partie there can be no Eſtoppel as to any part in that caſe, alſo as to that part of his argument Mr. <hi>Walter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on the other ſide, and alſo he ſaid, that if a grant of the Queeen were void at the Common Law for default of want of conſideration, this Statute aids not; <hi>Walter</hi> for the Defendant, and he divided the caſe into foure points,
<list>
                           <item>the firſt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Tenant for life by the Kings guift by ſurrendring his letters Patents hath alſo ſurrendred his eſtate.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, if the ſurrender in this caſe made be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective only for want of matter of circumſtance as the inrolment &amp;c. whether ſuch defects are ſaved by the Statute <hi>43. Eliz.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>Thirdly, whether in this caſe an actual ſurrender be the conſideration meerly which moveth the Queen to grant, or what ſhall be intended the conſideration in this caſe.</item>
                           <item>Fourthly, admitting that an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſurrender is the ſole conſideration in this caſe, then whether a Patent ſhall be adjudg'd void for default of ſuch conſideration, for a falſe conſideration doth not avoid a Patent, but a falſe ſurmiſe doth firſt when the Kings Tenant for life doth ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render or give up his Patent (although without deed) yet with ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as the law requireth, the ſurrender is good: for although a ſurrender of letters Patents made by the Kings Tenant in tail will not make eſtate tail void or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, as it appears by the book caſe of <hi>35. H. 8.</hi> title ſurrender and <hi>Cook 6.</hi> the <hi>Lord Chandos caſe,</hi> yet the bare giving up of the letters Patents by a Tenant for life is a ſurrender of his eſtate, ſo here in this caſe is ſome proportion between a Tenant for life of the Queen, and a Tenant for life of a Common perſon to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a ſurrender, and therefore it appeareth by <hi>43. E. 3.</hi> that a Tenant for life may ſurrender without deed; and without livery and from the land, but a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail may not do ſo: alſo if a Common perſon hath a rent or other thing which cannot paſs but by deed, yet a ſurrender of ſuch a rent ſhall be good by a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97330:8"/>bare deliverie up of the deed if he hath but an eſtate for life in the Rent: and this alſo, although it be but to the diſſeiſſor of the land out of which &amp;c. the ſame Law, he took it of a particular Tenant for life of years: alſo <hi>32. H. 8.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list> 
                        <hi>Brook Patents 97.</hi> it is made a doubt whether the eſtate tail of the Kings Donee be determined and gone by ſurrendring of the letters Patent, and he referred that if thought worthy of a doubt whether it ſhould be a good ſurrender of an eſtate tail, they would hade held it clearly a ſurrender for an eſtate for life: and it was admitted <hi>3. Eli 2. Dyer fo. 193. Mack-Williams caſe,</hi> that if in the principal caſe if a <hi>Vacat</hi> or cancellation had been, the ſurrender had been good actually without queſtion: and Sir <hi>Maurice Barkleys caſe</hi> cited on the other part proves the ſame alſo, for there it is admitted, that if the letters Patents had been given up, there had been a perfect ſurrender. And <hi>40. H. 3. fol. 5. Belknap</hi> held that a ſurrender may be by word, which is to be intended by giving up the Patent: and that appears by <hi>Rolfs caſe</hi> in <hi>Dyer,</hi> that a voluntary ſurrender needs no <hi>Conftat:</hi> alſo where it hath been objected that the ſpecial verdict in this caſe hath not found in what Court the ſurrender was made, he anſwered, that the Law ſhall intend it to be made in the ſame Court from whence the letters Patents did iſſue, for a ſurrender cannot be good being made in another Court, and therefore it muſt needs be intended the ſame Court: and he vouched <hi>11. Ed. 3. fo. 1.</hi> and <hi>18. Eliz. Plinies Caſe and Covel and Cabels Caſe in Banco Regis 38. Eliz.</hi> wherein a ſpecial verdict it was holden that all things neceſſary for the perfecting of that the Iury hath found to be done, muſt be neceſſarily intended concurrent. Secondly, the want of circumſtances in a ſurrender are perfected and ſupplied by the Statute of <hi>43. Eliz.</hi> for although matters of ſubſtance are not aided within this Statute, yet matters of circumſtances are aided. And he ſaid that all the defects in this Caſe are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of circumſtance, and to prove that the defects in this Caſe are only in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, he ſaid that there are three principal defects in conveyances which are meerly matters of circumſtance and aided within this Statute,
<list>
                           <item>the firſt is meerly want of form in a conveyance, and that ſuch a defect is aided, he cited <hi>Huſſies Caſe</hi> to be adjudged accordingly;</item>
                           <item>the ſecond is where words are wanting in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, and that ſuch a conveyance is aided by this Statute, he cited the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Popham and Gawdy in 44. Eliz.</hi> in a cauſe depending in the Chancery:</item>
                           <item>the third matter of circumſtance is where there is want of ſome matter concerning the executing of an eſtate, and that ſuch defect is only matter of circumſtance and aided within this Statute he cited <hi>Morley and Whartons Caſe</hi> to be adjudged <hi>7. Eliz.</hi> in the Common Pleas, that the default of not inrolling is aided by this Statute, and <hi>Mack-Williams and Kemps</hi> Caſe cited in <hi>Dyer</hi> before, proves this to be but matter of circumſtance, and for that he thought the ſurrender in the principal Caſe wanting nothing but inrolment is aided by this Statute: alſo in the argument of the ſecond point he ſhews what defects in conveyances ſhould be accompted matter of ſubſtance and ſo not aided by this Statute of <hi>43. Eliz.</hi> and to this purpoſe he held: that all diſabilities of the perſon in a grant is matter of ſubſtance, and ſo not aided within this Statute; and he cited <hi>Twynes Caſe 32. Eliz.</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> to be accordingly.</item>
                        </list> Secondly, he held that the nature of an aſſurance is not aided by this Statute, and therefore if a man hath power to grant an eſtate by fine, and he doth it by Deed, this is not aided by the Statute, for this is defective in matter of ſubſtance, and he cited <hi>Wiſemans Caſe,</hi> and Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmleys Caſe in Cook l. 2.</hi> alſo he ſaid if a man give land to the King and his heirs to have ten years after ſuch grant, this is not made good by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. Thirdly, whereas it may be Collected, that becauſe it is found in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial verdict that an actual ſurrender was the cauſe which moved the Queen to grant, or that it appears to be the cauſe, he held that no conſideration plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth but only by relation to a conſideration before mentioned, and he ſaid that theſe words uſed by the Queen <hi>viz. (modo habens et gaudens)</hi> ſhew that the Queen took notice the ſtate was ſtill injoyed notwithſtanding the delivery up of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97330:8"/>letters Patents; and therefore it cannot be intended by the verdict that the Queen intended an actual ſurrender before made for the conſideration: but whereas it hath been objected of the other part, that the word <hi>modo</hi> doth often ſignifie the time paſt, and ſome inſtances according to Grammatical conſtruction were given in proof thereof; and thereupon they would infer that the Queen by theſe words <hi>modo habens</hi> did intend no other but lately having or injoying: to that he gave a double anſwer; to the firſt he ſaid, that there was no cauſe ſhewed or inſtance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. That <hi>modo habens</hi> joyned together will ſignifie a time paſt, though taken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>everally that may ſignifie ſo much, which makes a plain difference betwixt thoſe inſtances, and this preſent caſe. Secondly, admitting in a Grammatical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction they did ſignifie as the other ſide would have it, yet the judges ought to adjudge thereof according to the moſt natural ſence of theſe words in Common underſtanding, and that ſo it may be done, he vouched one <hi>Talbots Caſe</hi> in <hi>32 Eliz. in Banco Regis,</hi> in which after the Iudges had conferred in the Court with divers learned Schollers touching the Grammatical conſtruction of a word uſed in a Convey ance, they afterwards notwithſtanding did wave the Grammatical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and adjudged the word to ſignifie in Law according to the Common received ſenſe of the word, and according to this he vouched <hi>12. H. 8.</hi> where the word <hi>uterque</hi> received the like conſtruction: alſo he vouched the <hi>20. Eliz. Dyer fol. 262.</hi> where it is admitted, that the word <hi>modo</hi> is to be taken in the preſent Tenſe, and to this purpoſe he alſo vouched <hi>Billings Caſe in 38. H. 6.</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuns Caſe Coo. lib. 4.</hi> and then he concluded that in aſmuch as the ſpecial ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict had definitively found no conſideration, but generally for the conſideration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove expreſt, he held that the ſecond Patent was good, for a Patent cannot be void, becauſe there is no conſideration to move the King to grant, but a Patent may be void as is pretended for a falſe conſideration, which is not in this caſe, and therefore &amp;c. Fourthly, admitting that the conſideration in this Caſe was for an actual ſurrender before made, and that in this caſe no ſuch actual ſurrender was before made, yet he held that in this Caſe the ſecond leaſe is good: notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the falſe conſideration, for it appears by <hi>37. H. 8. Brook title patents 100.</hi> that a Patent ſhall never be void for a falſe conſideration, but by reaſon of a falſe ſurmiſe it may; but he confeſſed this difference was generally denied, becauſe a Patent ſhall be void by reaſon of a falſe conſideration, but he ſaid that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences were infinite alſo upon this ground, for ſome take a difference where a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is real, and where it is perſonal, and they hold that a real conſideration being falſe ſhall not avoid the grant, but otherwiſe of a perſonal, and ſo they take the Book of <hi>37. H. 8.</hi> before cited to be good Law; and upon this difference o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo have taken a difference where the conſideration is to come to the King himſelf, and where it is to come to a ſtranger: others alſo have taken a difference where the conſideration is of a thing valuable, and where it is not of value, yet they take a difference where that is paſt and executed, and where it is to come or Executorie; but he ſaid that although divers of theſe differences ſeemed to be good with great reaſons, and were backed with ſome Authorities, yet he needed not to take advantage of any of them for the maintenance of this Caſe, and for that he took this general difference for the maintenance of this Patent, <hi>viz.</hi> that if the conſideration be ſuch which brings a benefit or commonditie to the King, and this is falſe, that this avoyds the grant; but if it bring no commoditie to the King, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be falſe, yet the grant is good, and to prove this diverſitie, he cited <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris and Wings Caſe</hi> to be adjudged in <hi>Banco Regis,</hi> and <hi>Barwicks Caſe Cook lib. 5.</hi> and Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmleys Caſe Cook. lib. 2.</hi> to be adjudged accordingly of a falſe recital, and he ſaid, although it be admitted that the conſideration which the King intended to have was an actual ſurrender, yet in aſmuch as this cannot be intended a thing more to his advantage, then a ſurrender in Law, the which plainly appears to be in this caſe, that the Patent is good, and for that he held that the ſecond leaſe ſhall not be avoided for ſuch a falſitie, and alſo he ſaid that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97330:9"/>this Caſe is more ſtrong of his ſide then any Caſe which may be cited, in aſmuch as the King had no diſcommoditie or loſs by the falſitie of the conſideration, but in this Caſe alſo he ſhould be at a loſs if the ſecond leaſe were not good, for the ſecond leaſe reſerveth a greater rent to the King, then was reſerved by the firſt, and therefore it is for his benefit, that the Law ſhould allow of the ſecond leaſe, to the intent it may make a ſurrender of the former leaſe, for the Kings advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and if the King granteth <hi>probis hominibus de O.</hi> rendring rent they are by this grant impliedly made a corporation for the benefit of the King to render him the rent, whereas otherwiſe the grant would be void; and ſo he took it in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal caſe although the grant ſhould be void, by reaſon of the falſe conſideration, yet it ſhould be good to this purpoſe for the Kings benefit: and after <hi>Termino Mich. Anno Sexto Jacobi Regis</hi> this Caſe was argued again, and <hi>Nicholas</hi> Serjeant for the Defendant ſaid, that the ſole point of the Caſe is, if the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the leaſe made in <hi>27. Eliz.</hi> be good or not, and this is expreſt to be <hi>Tam in conſideratione ſurſum reddditionis praedict. quam pro aliis Cauſiis, et Conſiderationibus &amp;c.</hi> then it is to be conſidered if here be ſuch a ſurrender as is meant to be within the intent of the Conſideration of the Queen, and he ſaid that in this Caſe here was a good ſurrender in law clearly by the Book of <hi>37. H. 6.</hi> for in all Caſes where a Teimer for years accepts a leaſe of him in Reverſion as here the Lord <hi>Seymor</hi> did, then this is a ſurrender in Law of his firſt intereſt, but the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> Lord Treaſurer ſaid, that this is not properly a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this Antient Term, but an extinguiſhment thereof, to which the Lord chief Baron <hi>Tanfield</hi> agreed: and Serjeant <hi>Nichols</hi> further ſaid, that the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which moved the Queen to her grant was only the ſufficient ſurrendring of the precedent eſtate of the Lord <hi>Seymor,</hi> and not the reſtoring of the letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and therefore although it be admitted, that here was not a ſufficient reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the letters Patents, nor an actual ſurrender by this means, yet here is an effectual ſurrender by the operation of Law, and then this being the ſole Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration which moved the Queen to her grant, the not ſufficient reſtoring of the letters Patents is not material, for he ſaid, it ſeemed to him that in <hi>rei veritate</hi> the particular eſtate cannot be ſufficiently ſurrendred by this bare giving up of the letters Patents by the Tenant for life, as it appears by <hi>Walſhes Caſe</hi> cited in <hi>Altonwoods Caſe Cook lib. 1.</hi> and therefore he inſiſted not upon that. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he argued that a recital in the Kings Patents of a thing material if it be falſe, and come by information of the partie is all one as a falſe Conſideration and not otherwiſe: and he ſaid that it appears by <hi>Brook tit. Patents pla. 100.</hi> that all Conſiderations valuable, although they are falſe do not avoid a Patent, as where the King grants lands <hi>prodecem libris ſibi ſolutis,</hi> although that in <hi>facto</hi> this is falſe, yet the grant is good: alſo it appears by <hi>26. H. 8.</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Wrothes Caſe,</hi> and by <hi>21. E. 4 fol. 48.</hi> that a conſideration executed avoideth not a grant although it be falſe, but he ſaid that it appears by the Caſe of <hi>18. Eliz. Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er 352.</hi> that if the King make a leaſe in Conſideration of a ſurrender of a precedent leaſe which in truth was void, by ſome that the King may avoid the leaſe, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers contrary, becauſe it was not done upon the ſuggeſtion of the partie, but for a conſideration executed, and the ſurrender of the eſtate precedent was the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cauſe and conſideration of the grant: and he ſaid, that although in this Caſe there be not a good ſurrender of the letters Patents, yet the Conſideration being only the ſurrendring of the eſtate, that is not material, for as it is ſaid in <hi>Alton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods Caſe Cook lib. 1.</hi> if the King in Conſideration only of the ſurrender of precedent Patents makes a grant, in this Caſe there needs no averment of an eſtate, for the ſurrender is not material of the letters Patents. Alſo it appears <hi>Cholm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys Caſe Cook lib. 2.</hi> that if the King recite an eſtate to be made with Condition, although that at the ſame time of the recital this is not Conditional, yet if once this were Conditional the King is not deceived, although the condition be now relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and he cited alſo the Lord <hi>Chandos Caſe Cook lib. 6.</hi> where it appears that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97330:9"/>if the King recite a thing untruly which cometh not of the information of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, this ſhall not hurt the Grant, except it be part of the conſideration, and he ſaid, that <hi>Harris</hi> and <hi>Wings</hi> Caſe differs from this Caſe, for there the King had a Tenant who held a Tenement by the yearly rent of ſix pounds, and another Tenement of him by the yearly rent of nineteen pounds, and he made a new leaſe of both thoſe to the ſaid Tenant, without any recital of the former leaſes reſerving but Nineteen pounds for both, and there it was adjudged, that the ſecond leaſe was not good, but he ſaid, that the reaſon of that judgement was, not becauſe the antient leaſe was not recited, but by reaſon that a loſs in the rent came to the King, and ſo by intendment he was deceived, and this was alſo upon the matter the reaſon of the reſolution of <hi>Barwicks Caſe,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Mack-Williams Caſe,</hi> for there was not a ſurrender of the eſtate as the King intended, which ought to be, but in our Caſe the eſtate is well ſurrendred clearly, and he thought that theſe words <hi>(modo habens)</hi> may well ſtand with the Kings intent aſwel to a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Law, as to an actual ſurrender. The Attorney generall to the contrary.

                        </gap>ſo it appears by the pleading in <hi>Plowden in Wrotheſleys caſe,</hi> and in <hi>Adams caſe,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Fulmerſtons caſe;</hi> that although the antient particular eſtate be gone in Law by the acceptance of a new eſtate, yet it ought not to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a ſurrender, and therefore it ſhall not be conſtrued that the King intended ſuch a ſurrender, which pleaders in their pleading do not accompt a ſurrender: alſo he ſaid, that in regard that the Queen ſaith, <hi>quam quidem ſurſum redditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem acceptamus</hi> it ſeems by that, that ſhe did not intend a ſurrender in Law, and therefore accepted nothing, but gave an eſtate &amp;c. and muſt be meant ſuch a ſurrender, to which ſhe is partie by her acceptance: alſo where the words are, <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do habens et gaudens,</hi> and therefore it is inferred that the Queen intended an eſtate containing in the Patentee this is true, for although that the Queen inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an actual ſurrender precedent to be made by the Patentee, yet his eſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues againſt the Queen untill an acceptance of a ſurrender by her, although alſo this may be called a ſurrender like unto a ſurrender of a benefice, untill an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by the ordinary: alſo although it was found that the Queen made a new leaſe or letters Patents of the ſaid Land to the ſaid Lord <hi>Seymor,</hi> yet it appears not that the new letters Patents were accepted by the Lord <hi>Seymor</hi> until a moneth after the making of them when he made a leaſe to <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and until that time without queſtion there was no ſurrender either in fact, or in Law; and where it hath been objected that theſe words <hi>(modo habens)</hi> implie only the preſent time, he ſaid that the word <hi>modo</hi> will alwayes ſignifie ſuch a time as the Verb with which it is joyned will ſignifie, and therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, <hi>modo hoc malum in hanc Rempublicam invaſit:</hi> alſo the words <hi>Jam et nunc,</hi> are of ſuch ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication as this word <hi>modo</hi> is: and theſe words are alwayes governed by the Verb, as <hi>Jam venit &amp;c.</hi> ſo in the Bible the ſtory of <hi>Naaman and Geheſey, Jam modo venerunt duo,</hi> behold two young men are come to me &amp;c. and as to the ſecond point it is clear, that here is not any actual ſurrender, for the King cannot take by an actual ſurrender without matter of Record. And therefore it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97330:10"/>was holden in the Lord <hi>Stanleys Caſe,</hi> that the King took nothing although his officers, by his command did feiſe a mans lands into their hands for the Kings uſe: alſo he ſaid, that this appears by the <hi>11. E. 4.</hi> and <hi>2. Eliz. Dyer,</hi> if a man comes and ſaith, that he ſurrenders his office, and a <hi>Memorandum</hi> is recorded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but the Patent is not delivered up, it ſeems this is not ſufficient to make a ſurrender, ſo on the other ſide, if the Patentee make a deed purporting aſmuch: yet it appeareth by <hi>19.</hi> of <hi>Eliz. Dyer,</hi> if the deed be not inrolled it is a good ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, and he agreed to that which hath been objected againſt him, that although that the Iury did not finde in what Court the reſtoring of the Patent was, yet it ought to be intended to be made in Chancery, but he ſaid that the Iury did not finde any time when the ſurrender was made, and that is a thing material to be found as it appears in <hi>Kemps Caſe,</hi> and <hi>Mack Williams Caſe</hi> before. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an actual ſurrender being in the King, new letters Patents urged to be made ſhall be intended to be part of the conſideration which moved the King to a new grant, and he vouched <hi>18. Eliz. Dyer 352<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> where a leaſe was recited which need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, and in <hi>facto,</hi> the ſaid leaſe was a void leaſe in Law. And therefore the new leaſe made was alſo void <hi>à fortiori</hi> here where an actual ſurrender is recited to be made. Fourthly, he ſaid, that the ſole reaſon in <hi>Harris and Wings caſe</hi> was, that the firſt leaſe ought to have been recited, for if the King makes a leaſe, and after makes another leaſe of the ſame land to the ſame leſſee, the firſt leaſe is in being at the time of the acceptance of the new leaſe, as appears by <hi>Fulmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtons caſe in Plowden,</hi> and therefore if in ſuch caſe there be not a good recital of the leaſe in being, the ſecond leaſe is not good, and ſo the acceptance of it makes no ſurrender of the former leaſe, and he ſaid that the recital of the Queen in the principal Caſe is a ſhewing of a former leaſe deſtroyed, and not in being, and then no actual ſurrender being made, the ſaid former leaſe contrary to this recital is in being ſtill, and ſo the recital is falſe, and conſequently the ſecond leaſe is a void leaſe, and ſo this worketh no ſurrender in Law of the old leaſe, and ſo he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the fourth point, that here is no ſurrender in Law, and he held that if there had been a good ſurrender in Law, yet this had not made the Patent good, and where it was objected, that a conſideration executed though valuable being falſe avoyds not a Patent, he ſaid it appears in <hi>6. Ed. 2. tit. pardon Brook 79.</hi> that a conſideration of ſervice in the Kings Patent ought to be alledged to have been performed, nevertheleſs it appears in Sir <hi>Thomas Worths caſe in Plowden,</hi> that ſuch a particular ſervice being alledged in the Patent to be executed needs not an averment that it was performed, for the Patent is good although ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be falſe; but he ſaid, that in this Caſe the precedent ſurrender is the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conſideration, and therefore there ought not to be any material variance in the form of the conſideration, and ſo is the difference betwixt this Caſe, and <hi>Worths Caſe,</hi> and therefore if the King make a grant to <hi>A.</hi> in conſideration, that he had releaſed by deed inrolled, and he had releaſed by fine, here is a failing of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that he had releaſed by deed inrolled, when as he had releaſed by fine, and ſo the grant is void, and he ſaid that as it appears by the judgement given in <hi>Welſhes Caſe</hi> cited in <hi>Altonwoods Caſe,</hi> that no equitie ought to be obſerved in the Kings grant againſt his expreſs words, ſo here no equitie ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved againſt the King, otherwiſe then his plain words import, and therefore here his words import and intend an actual ſurrender precedent, which ought not to be ſatisfied with a ſurrender ſubſequent: and after upon the motion of the Earl of <hi>Salisbury Lord Treaſurer of England,</hi> this Caſe was referred to the Lord <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who awarded to Sir <hi>Robert Johnſon 200 l. per annum</hi> during his life, and the life of his wife for all his intereſt; but the Earl of <hi>Salisbury Lord Treaſurer</hi> ſeemed that the matter in Law was againſt Sir <hi>Robert Johnſon,</hi> although that equitie was for him, to which opinion <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field chief Baron</hi> alſo inclined, in regard there was not here any ſurrender in the Caſe, but an extinguiſhment only.</p>

<list>
                           <item>Firſt, if the election made by the Veſtrie men were a good election to make them a Corporation capable to purchaſe within the intent of the Kings Charter, in ſo much that ſaith, that they ſhall be elected by the greater number of the Pariſhioners, and here but a ſmall number that is the Veſtrie elected them; and as to that it ſeems by the Barons, that in regard it was not given in evidence that others of the Pariſh to a great number did withſtand, or gain-ſay the ſaid election or nomination, it being made at a day uſual and place certain, and therefore all the Pariſhioners by intendment were knowing of it, or might by intendment of Law have been preſent at the ſaid election, it being in an open place where every Pariſhioner might make reſort, and did not, therefore it was held that this election was as good as if all the Pariſhioners had met and elected them, for it were hard in Law, if the election by theſe that are preſent ſhould not be good when the reſidue are wilfully abſent, and therefore <hi>Tanfield</hi> chief Baron cited a Caſe, where the King did grant that the Pariſhioners of <hi>Wallingford</hi> ſhould be a corporation to bargain and ſell, and that the greater number of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners there did make leaſes and eſtates, and there was an uſage, that at the time of meeting for the making of any ſuch leaſes by them, they did uſe to Ring a bell, by the which notice was intended to be given of the aſſembly: and that after ſuch Bell rung <hi>20.</hi> of the Pariſhioners then preſent did make a leaſe, there being <hi>100.</hi> others in the Pariſh not preſent, and yet this was adjudged in the Court <hi>32.

                           <item>Secondly, it was moved, that although this were not good to make them Church-wardens within the intent of the Kings Charter of Corporations, yet that this leaſe made by the King, ſhould amount to make them a Corporation, and to a leaſe unto them alſo, that being by intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the benefit of the King, inaſmuch as a rent is reſerved; like as when the King makes a leaſe, to the honeſt men of <hi>Iſlington</hi> rendring rent, but unto this <hi>Tanfield</hi> the chief Baron ſaid, that he held, that this leaſe ſhould not make a corporation where the King conceived, that there was no corporation before, but

                     <p>AN Information was exhibited againſt <hi>Bates</hi> a Merchant of the levant, and it was recited, that the King by his letters Patents under the great Seal had commanded his Treaſurer, that he command the cuſtomers, and receivers, that they ſhould ask and receive of every Merchant denizen, who brings within any Port within his dominions, any Currants five ſhillings a hundred, for impoſt above two ſhillings and ſix pence, which was the Poundage by the Statute of every hundred, and it was alledged; that <hi>Bates</hi> had notice thereof, and that he had brought in Currants into the Port of London, and refuſed to pay the ſaid <hi>5.</hi> s. in contempt of the King, whereunto <hi>Bates</hi> came, and ſaid, that he is an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Merchant, and an venturer and a denizen, and that he made a voyage to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and there bought Currants, and imported them into England, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the Statute of the firſt of King <hi>James cap. 33.</hi> which grants <hi>2.</hi> s. <hi>6.</hi> d. for Poundage, and he ſaid, that he had paid that, and therefore he had refuſed to pay the <hi>5.</hi> s. becauſe it was impoſed unjuſtly, and unduly againſt the Lawes of the land, whereupon the Kings Attorney demurred in Law; this matter had been divers times argued at the Bar, and at the Bench, by <hi>Snig, and Savil,</hi> Barons, and now by <hi>Clark and Flemming</hi> chief Baton whoſe arguments I only heard, and <hi>Clark,</hi> who argued firſt this day ſaid, that this Caſe being of ſo great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence great reſpect, and conſideration is to be had, and it ſeemeth to me ſtrange, that any ſubjects would contend with the King, in this high point of Prerogative; but ſuch is the Kings grace, that he had ſhewed his intent to be, that this matter ſhall be diſputed and adjudged by us according to the antient Law and cuſtome of the Realm, and becauſe that the judgement of this matter cannot be well directed by any learning delivered in our Books of Law, the beſt directions herein are preſedents of antiquitie, and the courſe of this Court, wherein all actions of this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97330:14"/>nature are to be judged, and the Acts of Parliament recited in arguments of this Caſe prove nothing to this purpoſe, the beſt caſe in Law, is the Caſe of Mines in Mr. <hi>Plowden Com.</hi> where this ground is put, that the precedents of every Court, ought to be a direction to that Court, to judge of matters which are apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determinable therein, as in the Kings Bench for matters of the Crown, in the Common Pleas for matters of inheritance and Civil contracts, and in the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi> for matters of the Kings Prerogative, his revenues, and government, and as it is not a Kingdome without ſubjects and government, ſo he is not a King without revenues, for without them he cannot preſerve his dominions in peace, he cannot maintain war, nor reward his ſervants, according to the ſtate and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of a King, and the revenue of the Crown is the very eſſential part of the Crown, and he who rendeth that from the King pulleth alſo his Crown from his head, for it cannot be ſeparated from the Crown, and ſuch great Prerogatives of the Crown, (without which it cannot be) ought not to be diſputed, and in theſe caſes of Prerogative the judgement ſhall not be, according to the rules of the Common Law, but according to the Preſidents of this Court wherein theſe matters are diſputable and determinable, as for Example, an action of accompt lies not by the Common Law againſt him, who had the land of the accomptant by mean conveyance, but if one be an accomptant to the King, and had land in fee, and alien it unto <hi>A.</hi> who alien it unto <hi>B. B.</hi> by reaſon of this land ſhall be charged with this accompt: in <hi>14. E. 3.</hi> a Coroner was elected by the Kings writ as he ought to be, by the Countie, and after be was amerced, and becauſe he was not ſufficient to anſwer the Amercement the Countie was charged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and that appears of Record here, and in <hi>30. E. 3. Rot. 6.</hi> as appears alſo of Record, in this Court one <hi>William Porter</hi> was <hi>Magiſter monetae,</hi> and had received Bullien of divers Merchants, and Coyned it in the Kings Mint, and did not reſtore the Coyne to the Merchants, but was inſufficient, and the King paid the Merchants, and inquired of the ſuerties for the Coyne, and it was found that he had none, then it was inquired who recommended him unto the King, and it was found by whom he was recommended: and they who only recommended him as friends, were charged with the Debt, and if one be outlawed in a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal action, and Debt is due to him upon a contract, this ſhall be forfeited to the King, and this is ordinary by the Preſidents of this Court, and yet this ſeems to be contrary to Law, and is againſt our Books, and the Kings Debtor ſhall have a <hi>quo minus</hi> againſt Executors upon a ſimple contract, and therein he cannot releaſe, nor be non-ſuited, and I put theſe caſes to prove, that the preſidents of this Court ought to be purſued and obſerved, although they ſeem to croſs the Common Law, and the Books thereof: a caſe was here betwixt the King and <hi>Jourden, Jourden</hi> was receiver, and ſold his office to one <hi>D.</hi> and he not being able to pay <hi>Jourden</hi> for his office at the day limited, it was agreed, that <hi>Jourden</hi> ſhould come to the next receipt, and when <hi>D.</hi> received the Kings money, that <hi>Jourden</hi> ſhould take it for his office, which was done accordingly, after <hi>D.</hi> was indebted to the King, and this matter appearing as above &amp;c. <hi>Jourden</hi> was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the money which he had received, and as <hi>Stamford</hi> in his firſt <hi>cap.</hi> of Prerogative ſaith, that the King is the moſt worthy part of a Common-wealth ſo is he the preſerver, nouriſher, and defender of the people, and true it is, that the weal of the King is the publick weal of the people, and he for his pleaſure may a forreſt the word of any ſubject, and he thereby ſhall be ſubject to the Law of the Forreſt, and be may take the proviſion of any man by his Purvieour, for his own uſe but at reaſonable prizes, and without abuſe, the abuſe of which officer hath been reſtrained by divers Statutes, and the King may take wines for his proviſion, and alſo Timber for his Ships, Caſtles, or houſes in the wood of any man, and this is for publick benefit, and the King may allay, or inhaunce Coyne at his pleaſure, for the plentie of the King is the peoples peace, and theſe impoſts are not only for the benefit of the people, and for the Kings profit, but are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97330:15"/>alſo impoſed many times for the increaſe of Merchandiſe, and Commerce, as the Statute of, <hi>Aulnageors</hi> made in the <hi>2. E. 3. cap. 14.</hi> which was made princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to make cloathes more Vendible, and ſo Corporations are granted by the King with immunities and priviledges, and to ſeclude other ſubjects from them, are well limited and good, for it is for the increaſe of the peoples wealth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Kings revenue is increaſed, and ſometimes there is contained in grants a Prohibition to other ſubjects, that they uſury not upon the priviledges of ſuch Corporations upon a pain, as in the cuſtome of Forraign bought, and Forraign ſold in <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> and divers cuſtomes are permitted to ſuch Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as in the Chamberlain of <hi>Londons Caſe, Cook 5.</hi> and the breach or violation of theſe cuſtomes is a decay of the Corporations, and ſo an impairing of the revenues of the Crown, and therefore the King may make them, and alſo give them priviledges, and make inhibitions to others, not to Vſurp upon them: <hi>King Edward the third</hi> in the ſixteenth year of his Raign proclaimed, that no man ſhould ſell Wool-fels, or Leather under ſuch a price, ſo that theſe ſtaple commodities might not be debaſed, and this at no place, but at <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Anwick,</hi> and this proclamation was the cauſe wherefore the Merchant in <hi>43. Aſſiſe 38.</hi> was puniſhed for uſing the ſlight to abate the prices, and for preſidents in this matter of Impoſt, there are many of antiquitie, and firſt for Wines in <hi>16. E. 1.</hi> the cuſtome for a Tun of Wine was <hi>4.</hi> s. and <hi>21.</hi> and <hi>24. E. 3.</hi> it was increaſed to—and <hi>12.13. &amp; 14.</hi> of <hi>H. 8.</hi> it was increaſed to <hi>17.</hi> s. the Tun, and after in the 4th. of <hi>Mary</hi> it was increaſed to <hi>4.</hi> Marks, and as it appears by the Records of this Court, it was anſwered upon accompt, for all this time according to that rate, and it is apparant, that no act of Parliament gave this to the King, but that it was impoſed by his abſolute power, and ſhall it now be doubted if it be lawful? God defend Priſage, that the King ſhall have one Hogs-head before the Maſt, and another Hogs-head behinde, is not given to the King by any Statute, but was only an Impoſt by the Kings power, the Impoſt upon cloathes in <hi>31. E. 1.</hi> was two ſhillings for a Scarlet, and <hi>18.</hi> d. for other cloathes in Grain, and after in the 37th. year of <hi>E. 3.</hi> it was raiſed again and in the <hi>37. E. 3.</hi> an Act was made for the length of cloathes, in the <hi>33. H. 8.</hi> it was raiſed again, and in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> becauſe that the making of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cloathes made the Impoſt of Wooll to be of ſo ſmall value, therefore the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt of every cloath was raiſed by her to a noble, and in the firſt of <hi>Eliz.</hi> an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt was impoſed, for the overlength of cloathes, and it appears in <hi>30. <hi>E.</hi> 3.</hi> that the Impoſt of one Cloath was for a ſtranger <hi>2.</hi> s. <hi>8.</hi> d. and for a denizen <hi>1.</hi> s. and all for cloathes: another Impoſt was for Woolfels, and Leather, the <hi>31. E. 1.</hi> it was for Wooll half a Mark for a Sack, and after that to <hi>10.</hi> s. and in the time of <hi>E. 3.</hi> to <hi>20.</hi> s. and after to <hi>40.</hi> s. and after to <hi>3.</hi> l. and ſo of Woolfels and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as the benefit and price of commodities did riſe, ſo was the Impoſt raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and no Act of Parliament for the firſt impoſing, and increaſe thereof, and ſo much for Woolfels and Leather. Now for allom, upon every kintal of allom was impoſed <hi>3.</hi> s. <hi>4.</hi> d. which was anſwered upon accompt, and in the caſe of <hi>Smith</hi> it was not doubted if it ſhall be paid as here it is, but if it were contained in <hi>Smiths</hi> Patent or not, the impoſition impoſed upon Coles, now the <hi>1.</hi> s. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe is paid, the impoſition upon Tobacco was never doubted to be unjuſt as this is, and ſo much for preſidents. And now for Statutes, the Statute of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta cap. 30.</hi> which was objected, that thereby all Merchants may have ſafe &amp;c. to buy and ſell, without all Tolluets, but there is a ſaving, <hi>viz.</hi> by the antient and old cuſtoms: the Statute of <hi>Articuli ſuper chartas cap. 2.</hi> hath a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the end of it, that the King or his Councel did not intend thereby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the antient prices due and accuſtomed; ſo are all the other Statutes of Purveyors, the Statute of the <hi>45. E. 3. cap. 4.</hi> which hath been ſo much urged, that no new impoſition ſhall be impoſed upon Woolfels, wooll, or Leather, but only the cuſtome and ſubſidie granted to the King, this extends only to the King
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97330:15"/>himſelf, and ſhall not binde his ſucceſſors, for it is a principal part of the Crown of England, which the King cannot diminiſh, and the ſame King <hi>24.</hi> of his Raign granted divers exemptions to certain perſons, and becauſe that it was in derogation of his ſtate imperial, he himſelf recalled, and adnulled the ſame; as to that which was objected, that the Defendant had paid poundage granted by the Statute of the firſt to the King, that is nothing to this purpoſe, for that is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidie, and not a cuſtome, for when any impoſition is granted by Parliament, it is only a ſubſidie, and not a cuſtome, for the nature thereof is changed, and the impoſt of Wine is paid over, and above the poundage, and ſo ſhould it be here, and whereas it was objected, that if it were in the time of war, it is ſufferable, but in peace not, this ſeems no reaſon, for the King cannot be furniſhed to make defence in war, if he provide not in peace, and the proviſion is too late made, when it ought to be uſed, and as to that which was ſaid, that the ſubject ought to have recompence, and valuable ſatisfaction, it ſeemeth to me that he had; for he hath the Kings protection within his Ports, and his ſafe conduct upon the land, and his defence upon the Sea, and all the Ports of the Realm belong to the King, and in this Court, there is a preſident where one in the time of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have a Port to himſelf as his own, and it was adjudged that he could not, for it belonged to the Queen, and it could not be ſevered, and the King only ſhall have the cuſtomes, for landing throughout all the land, and in the <hi>17.</hi> of <hi>E. 3.</hi> there is a notable preſident, where he reciteth all the benefits, which the ſubject had in his forraign Traffick, by the Kings power and protection, and therefore he impoſed a new Impoſt: the writ of <hi>ne exeat Regnum</hi> comprehends a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him to whom it is directed, that he ſhall not go beyond the Seas, and this may be directed at the Kings pleaſure to any man, who is his ſubject, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently may he prohibite all Merchants, and as he may prohibite the perſons, ſo may he the goods of any man, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhall export or import at his pleaſure, and if the King may generally inhibite, that ſuch goods ſhall not be imported, then by the ſame reaſon may he prohibite them, upon condition or <hi>ſub modo, viz.</hi> that if they import ſuch goods: that then they ſhall pay &amp;c. and if the general be lawful the particular cannot be unjuſt, and the words in the writ of <hi>ne exeat Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, viz. et quam plurima nobis, et Coronae noſtrae praejudicialia ibidem proſequi intendis</hi> are not traverſable by the ſubject, but he ought dutifully to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his Soveraign: as to that, which is ſaid, that this command to the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is not ſufficient under the great Seal, that is otherwiſe, for before the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>R. 2.</hi> for matter of cuſtomes no command was directer to the Treaſurer, but alwayes the King ſignified his pleaſure to his cuſtomers under his privie Seal, and this gave authoritie to them to collect cuſtomes, and the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is given now to the Treaſurer, and derived from him to the cuſtomers, as to that which is ſaid, that the concluſion is evil, becauſe it is in contempt of the King, without doubt it is a contempt, for the King may inhibit Traffick into any part of the world, if he will, or inflict a pain upon any, who ſhall Trade into ſuch place inhibited, ſo may he do upon any commoditie either inhibit it generally, or upon a pain or Impoſt, and if a ſubject uſe the Trade after ſuch inhibition, or import his wars, and pay not the impoſt, it is a contempt, and the King ſhall puniſh him for it, at his pleaſure; and as to that which is ſaid, that it is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to the Merchant, that is not ſo, for the burthen layeth it only upon the better part of the ſubjects, and if it were a burthen, it is no more then they themſelves impoſed, which was in their hands by commiſſion in the time of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> and they have raiſed the prices to ſubjects more then the value of the Impoſt; and it is not to be intended, that the King by any Impoſt will prejudice the cauſe of Merchants, for the Trade in general is to him more beneficial, then any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Impoſt: the caſe of the <hi>11.</hi> and <hi>14. H. 4.</hi> of <hi>Aulnageor,</hi> is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to this Caſe, for there the King had made a grant to a ſubject, and it was alſo of a thing which was granted before to a Maior, and alſo of a commoditie
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97330:16"/>within the land, and not tranſported, and for the caſe of <hi>Darcy:</hi> for the mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly of Cards it is not like, for that is of a commoditie within the land, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Patentee, and the King, and not between the King, and the ſubject, and as to the exception taken to the Information, that it is Vſitar. and doth not preſcribe, this needeth not, for it is a prerogative wherein lieth no preſcription, for every prerogative is as antient as the Crown, and as to the concluſion of the Information it was objected, that it is not good, for the informer ought to pray the forfeiture; but this belongs to the Court to Iudge of what ſhall be loſt or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, the offence being a contempt, and therefore the concluſion good enough, and ſo for all theſe reaſons, judgement ſhall be given for the King. <hi>Flemming chief Baron,</hi> touching the exceptions to the Information they are of no force, for the firſt Vſitat &amp;c. it hath been well ſaid, that the King needs not preſcribe in any prerogative, for it is as antient as his Crown is, <hi>2. E. 3.</hi> and for the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>viz.</hi> that he in contempt &amp;c. that deſerves no other anſwer, but that which hath been given before, for it is enough, without doubt warranted by infinite preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, but for the Bar, it is an increaſe of the Defendants contempt, and no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient matter to anſwer an indigeſted and confuſed tale, with an improper and diſobedient concluſion, and there is in it <hi>multa non multum,</hi> but the concluſion is without preſident, or example, for he ſaith, that the impoſition which the King had laid, is <hi>indebite, injuſte, et contra leges Angliae impoſita,</hi> and therefore he refuſed &amp;c. in the caſe of <hi>Smith</hi> for Allom, the concluſion was moderate, and beſeeming a ſubject, judgement if he ſhall have Impoſt by his grant, and in the caſe of <hi>Mines,</hi> the Defendant being a great Peer of the Realm, concluded upon his grant and intereſt in the ſoyl, and that he took the Mettal, as it was lawful for him, and did not confront his Soveraign with terms of <hi>injuſte, indebitè,</hi> and the like, and the King as it is commonly ſaid in out Books cannot do wrong, and it the King ſeiſe my land without cauſe, I ought to ſue to him in humble manner, <hi>Humillimè ſupplicavit &amp;c.</hi> and not with ſuch terms of oppoſition in the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all his matter had been ſaved to him then as well as now, or he might have pleaded his matter, and ſaid wherefore he refuſed, as it was lawful for him: but for the matter it is of great conſequence, and hath two powerful objects, which it principally reſpecteth, the one is the King, his power, and prerogative, his Treaſure, and the Revenues of his Crown, and to impair and derogate from any of theſe was a part moſt undutiful in any ſubject, the other is the Trade and Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick of Merchantdiſe, tranſportation in and out of the land of commodities, which further publick benefit ought much to be reſpected, and nouriſhed as much as may be; the ſtate of the queſtion is touching a new cuſtome, Impoſitions or cuſtoms, are duties or ſumms of money newly impoſed: by the King without Parliament upon Merchantdiſe, for the augmentation of his revenues, all the queſtions ariſing in the caſe are, <hi>aut de perſonis, de rebus, vel de actionibus, viz.</hi> form and proceeding, the perſons are firſt the King, his power, and authoritie. Secondly, not <hi>Bates</hi> the Defendant, nor the Venetians, but all men who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Currants, the impoſition is properly upon Currants, and for them, and is not upon the Defendant, nor his goods, who is a Merchant, for upon him no impoſition ſhall be, but by Parliament. The things are Currants a forraign commoditie, and a Victual; the <hi>5.</hi> s. for impoſt which is ſaid to be great, the action formed or Proceſs is the command by the great Seal, and the word there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are <hi>Petere et recipere,</hi> if they be ſufficient, and if good without Proclamation or other notice, and how notice ſhall be given, and if it be good without an <hi>ad quod damnum,</hi> and the caſe of <hi>Mines in Plowden,</hi> which is the ſole caſe in the printed Books of Law, to this purpoſe hath in it, foure reaſons of the judgement.

Br. à fortiori</hi> he may reſtrain the goods; there was no cuſtom for home Commodities, but the great cuſtom aforeſaid, which was after increaſed by Parliament, which was called the <hi>petit</hi> cuſtome: it is a great grace in the King to the Merchants, that he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and permit this matter to be diſputed between him and his ſubject, and the moſt fit place is in this Court, and the beſt rules herein are the preſidents thereof, and pollitick reaſons, which I ſhall give, and apply them to the particulars before recited, and firſt, for the perſon of the King, <hi>omnis poteſtas à deo, et non eſt poteſtas niſi pro Bono,</hi> to the King is committed the Government of the Realm and his people, and <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith, that for his diſcharge of his office, God had, given to him power, the Act of Government, and the power to Govern: the Kings power is double, ordinary and abſolute, and they are ſeveral Lawes and ends, that of the ordinary is for the profit of particular ſubjects, for the Execution of Civil Iuſtice, the determining of <hi>Meum,</hi> and this exerciſed by equitie end Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in ordinary Courts, and by the <hi>Civillians</hi> is nominated <hi>Jus privatum,</hi> and with us Common Law, and theſe Laws cannot be changed, without Parliament, and although that their form and courſe may be changed, and interrupted, yet they can never be changed in ſubſtance: the abſolute power of the King is not that which is converted or executed to private uſe, to the benefit of any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but is only that which is applied to the general benefit of the people, and is <hi>Salus populi;</hi> as the people is the body, and the King the head; and this power is guided by the Rules, which direct only at the Common Law, and is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly named pollicy and Government, and as the conſtitution, of this body va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth with the time, ſo varieth this abſolute Law, according to the wiſdome of the King, for the Common good, and theſe being general rules and true as they are, all things done within theſe rules are Lawful; the matter in queſtion is material matter of ſtate, and ought to be ruled by the rules of pollicy, and if it be ſo, the King hath done well to execute his extraordinary power; all cuſtomes be they old or new, are no other but the effects and iſſues of Trades, and commerce with forraign Nations, but all commerce and affairs with forrainers, all wars and peace, all acceptance and admitting for Currant forrain Coyn: all parties and Treaties whatſoever are made by the abſolute power of the King, and he who hath power of cauſes, hath power alſo of effects, no exportation or importation can be, but at the Kings Ports, they are the Gates of the King, and he hath abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power by them to include or exclude whom he ſhall pleaſe, and Ports to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are their Harvours, and repoſe, and for their better ſecuritie he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to provide Bulworks, and Fortreſſes, and to maintain, for the collection of his cuſtoms and duties, collectors, and cuſtomers, and for that charge it is reaſon, that he ſhould have this benefit: he is alſo to defend the Merchants from Pirats at Sea in their paſſage, alſo, by the power of the King they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, if they are oppreſſed by forrain Princes, and his Treaty, and Embaſſage, and he be not remedied thereby, then <hi>lex Talionis</hi> ſhall be executed, goods for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97330:17"/>goods, and Tax for Tax, and if this will not redreſs the matter, then war is to be attempted, for the cauſe of Merchants: in all the Kings Courts, and of other Princes, the Iudges in them are paid by the King, and maintained by him to do Iuſtice to the ſubjects, and therefore he hath the profits of the ſaid Courts: it is reaſonable that the King ſhould have aſmuch power over forrainers, and their goods as upon his own ſubjects, and if the King cannot impoſe upon forrain Commodities a cuſtome, aſwel as forrainers may upon their own Commodities, and upon the Commodities of this land when they come to them, then forrain ſtates ſhall be inriched, and the King impoveriſhed, and he ſhall not have equal profit with them, and yet it will not be denied, but his power herein is equal with other ſtates, and ſo much for the perſon of <hi>Bates</hi> the ſubject: it is ſaid, that an impoſition may not be upon a ſubject without Parliament: that the King may impoſe upon a ſubject, I omit, for it is not here the queſtion, if the King may impoſe upon the ſubject or his goods, but the impoſt here is not upon a ſubject, but here it is upon <hi>Bates,</hi> as upon a Merchant, who imports goods within this land, charged before by the King, and at the time when the impoſt was impoſed upon them, they were the goods of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and not the goods of a ſubject, nor within the land, but only upon thoſe which ſhall be after imported, and ſo all the arguments which were made for the ſubject, fail; and where it is ſaid, that he is a Merchant, and that he ought to have the Sea open and free for him, and that Trades of Merchants, and Merchandiſe is neceſſary to export before, the Surplus of our commodities, and then to import other neceſſaries, and ſo is favourably to be reſpected, as to that it is well known, that the end of every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Merchant is not the common good, but his particular profit, which is only the means, which induceth him to Trade and Traffick, and the impoſt to him is nothing, for he rateth his Merchandiſe according to that, the impoſt is impoſed upon Currants, and he who will buy them, ſhall have them ſubject to that charge, and it is a great contempt to denie the payment, and ſo much for the perſon: I will give a brief anſwer, to all the Statutes alledged on the contrary part, with this expoſition, that the ſubjects and Merchants are to be freed of Maletolt, and this was Toll unjuſtly exacted by <hi>London, Southampton,</hi> and other Ports within this Realm, but they are with this ſaving, that they pay the duties and cuſtomes, due, or which hereafter ſhall be due to the King, which is a full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to all the Statutes; the commoditie of Currants, is no commoditie of this land, but forrain, and whereas it is ſaid, that it is Victual and neceſſary food, it is no more neceſſary then Wine, and impoſt for that hath been alwayes paid, without contradiction, and without doubt, there are many drinkers of Wine, who are alſo eaters of Currants, that which ſhould be ſaid Victual for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is, that which ariſeth from Agriculture, and of the earth within this land, and not nice and delicate things imported by Merchants, ſuch as theſe Currants are, and are rather delicacy or Medicine then a Victual, and it is no reaſon that ſo many of our good and ſtaple Commodities; ſhould be exported to Venice, for ſuch a ſlight delicacy, and that all the impoſt ſhall be paid to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians for them, and the King ſhould have none for their Commoditie, and although that the price be thereby raiſed, this hurteth not the Merchant, nor no other, but only a ſmal number of delicate perſons, and thoſe alſo who are of moſt able and beſt eſtate, for their pleaſure, but when the King is in want, he is to be relieved by a general impoſition or ſubſidie upon all the ſubjects; the impoſition which is here ſaid, to be ſo great, and intollerable, is an evil preſident, for if he may do ſo much, he may do it in <hi>infinitum,</hi> and upon all other Merchandiſe: for the Impoſition I ſay, that it is reaſonable, for it is no more then foure times ſo much then was before, and that there hath been aſmuch done in antient time in other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, as in that of Wooll, which was at firſt but an Noble a fack, and is now at <hi>50.</hi> s. the Impoſt of Wine was in antient time <hi>3.</hi> s. <hi>4.</hi> d. a Tun, and now is foure Marks, the leſſening of cuſtome and Impoſt is much to be guided, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97330:17"/>from forrain Nations, for the uſage and behaviour of a forrain Prince may impoſe a neceſſitie of raiſing cuſtome of theſe Commodities, and ſo it was in the particular of Currants, the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> Impoſed upon them a ducket by the hundred, which by the wiſdom of the ſtate was foreſeen to be a means, that in time will waſte and conſume the Treaſure of the land, whereupon the Queen writ to the Duke, that he would abate his cuſtome, which he refuſed, wherefore to prevent, that ſo great a quantitie of this Commoditie ſhould not be imported into the land, the Queen granted to the company of Merchants of the Levant, that none ſhould bring in Currants, but by their Licence, and thoſe Merchants Impoſed upon them who did Import, which were not of their company, if he were denizen <hi>5.</hi> s. if he were a ſtranger <hi>10.</hi> s. and this was paid by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants without contradiction, but there was a clauſe in the Patent, that when the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> abated his Impoſt, that the Patent ſhould be void, and after the Duke was Solicited again, that he would abate the Impoſt, but he refuſed, and the firſt Commiſſion was recalled, and after a new grant was made, which was executed all the Queens life time, which was as aforeſaid; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid, that if the King may Impoſe, he may Impoſe any quantitie what he pleaſes, true it is, that this is to be referred to the wiſdom of the King, who guideth all under God, by his wiſdom, and this is not to be diſputed by a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and many things are left to his wiſdome for the ordering of his power, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then his power ſhall be reſtrained, the King may pardon any fellon, but it may be objected, that if he pardon one fellon he may pardon all, to the damage of the Common-wealth, and yet none will doubt, but that is left to his wiſdom, and as the King may grant a Protection for one year, ſo it may, be ſaid, that he may grant it for many years, which is a miſchief, and ſo ought to grant none, which will not be denied but that he may, ſo it may be ſaid, that the Queen may grant a ſafe conducted a ſtranger, for if ſhe may do that, then ſhe may grant to all, which would be but then ſame to the inhabitants, and yet it will not be denied; but that ſhe may grant to any or all, as in her wiſdome ſhall ſeem convenient, and the wiſdom and providence of the King is not to be diſputed by the ſubject, for by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

E. 1.</hi> in this Court, where it is Recorded, that the King had aſſigned Merchants to receive (uſing the ſame words which are uſed here) half a Mark for every Sack of Wool, and a Mark of every Laſt of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that if the Merchant who is ſo appointed Tranſport any after, that it ſhall be forfeited, and out of this record I obſerve, that three hundred Pelts make a Sack of Wooll: from the <hi>21. Ed. 1.</hi> unto the <hi>28. E. 1.</hi> the cuſtoms for Wools was <hi>40.</hi> s. a Sack, and in <hi>25. E. 1.</hi> the Impoſition of <hi>Maletolt</hi> was repealed by Act of Parliament, which <hi>Maletolt</hi> was an increaſe of Impoſt upon ſtaple com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and therfore was given to the King a great ſubſidie with this cauſe, that it ſhould never be drawn into preſident; which ſhews, that this <hi>Maletolt</hi> was rightly impoſed, otherwiſe the Parliament would never have given him ſo great a Recompence for the Abrogation of it: but after in the <hi>13.</hi> of <hi>E. 3.</hi> becauſe it was a thing of ſo great conſequence to the Crown. it was revived and made <hi>40.</hi> s. for Wool, and Woolfels, and <hi>3.</hi> l. for Leather for denizens, and double for ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: in the <hi>14. Ed. 3.</hi> a Petition in Parliament to abate it, and for a great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidie it was releaſed, and in the <hi>18.</hi> of <hi>Ed. 3.</hi> it was again revived, and a new peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made in Parliament, and this petition was continued until the <hi>36.</hi> of <hi>Ed. 3.</hi> and then it was abated, and alſo by the <hi>45. E. 3.</hi> it was again abated, ſo that it ſeem, that between theſe times it was revived, but after it did not continue long, for in <hi>48.

E. 1.</hi> as appears in this Court upon Record, it was commanded to the Bailiff of <hi>Dover</hi> to levie and Gollece of every Tun of Wine of a ſtranger <hi>4.</hi> s. and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97330:18"/>in the <hi>22. E. 1.2.</hi> s. thereof was releaſed, at the ſuit of the French Ambaſſador, in the <hi>26.</hi> of <hi>E. 3.</hi> the King granted priviledges to Merchants ſtrangers, but there was given for it an increaſe of cuſtome, and this was anſwered as it appears upon accompt in the times of <hi>E. 1.</hi> and <hi>E. 2.</hi> the caſe of Allom was as it hath been reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by my brother <hi>Clark:</hi> it is objected, that the Merchant ought to have free paſſage upon the Sea, but that both not conclude the King, but that he ſhall have his Impoſt if he cometh into his Ports, and here the queſtion is for Merchandiſe after that they are brought into the Port, but it is ſaid, that they cannot come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Port but by the Sea, that is true, but if this reaſon ſhould hold then the King could not grant Murage, Pontage, and the like, becauſe the common Channel to them is free, and Average is for ſecuritie aſwel as Ports: another objection, that the Defendant here is not reſtrained, but that is anſwered, for if a pain be inflicted upon them who import, this is an inhibition upon a pain to all; another objection was, that there was no conſideration of the Impoſition, and if it be demanded what differences between the caſes; I anſwer as much as is between the King, and a ſubject, and it is not reaſonable that the King ſhould expreſs the cauſe and conſideration of his Actions, for they are <hi>arcana Regis,</hi> and no ſatisfaction needeth, for if the profits to the Merchant faileth he will not trade, and it is for the benefit of every ſubject, that the Kings Treaſure ſhould be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: an objection was made againſt the form of proceeding, becauſe it was by the great Seal to the Treaſurer, and that he by the cuſtomers, <hi>Peteret et recipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi> and this could not be better, as it was anſwered before: it was objected that it ſhould be by Proclamation, and that needs not, for it toucheth not all the ſubjects, but only thoſe who are Traders in Merchandiſing, the beſt and apteſt means to give them notice by the cuſtomers, and it is alledged by the informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on expreſly, that he had notice. It was laſtly objected, that there ought to be <hi>a quod damnum</hi> in the caſe before the grant, that is not ſo, for that ſhall be only when the King granteth any thing which appertaineth to his prerogative, and not when he maketh Charters, to his ſervants to levy his duties due to his Crown, wherefore I think that the King ought to have judgement, which was after given accordingly.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97330:19"/>is good, and therefore alſo he cited a caſe to be adjudged in <hi>Banco Regis 41.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97330:23"/>and the finding of the Iury, it ſeemed to him, that there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them, but after the finding of the Iury upon an office, as our caſe is, and a pleading, there is no difference, for the office is a thing, to which an anſwer may be made, but a verdict given upon iſſue joyned between the parties, hath no other proceeding, but to judgement immediately; and therefore ſuch a verdict ſhall be divers times ſupplied by the conſtruction of the Iudges, but a verdict upon an office, ought to be as certain as an indictment, becauſe the partie may Traverſe, and to prove, that upon ſuch uncertain offices, there is no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by Traverſe, he vouched the caſe of <hi>3.

Eliz.</hi> between <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> a man pleaded for title that <hi>A.</hi> was ſeiſed, and by deed inrolled gave and granted ſuch land &amp;c. this is no good pleading, becauſe no ſufficient certainty therein, alſo it is not good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no certain time ſhewed of the grant made, and although that a grant by record is good, as it is in <hi>37.

                           <item>Firſt, he thought clearly, that this confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Bargainor, and the Bargainee was as an uſe at the Common Law, and that <hi>ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> ſhould not forfeit this uſe at the Common Law, is directly proved by <hi>11.

E. 4. fo. 7.</hi> where it appeareth that <hi>ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> ſhall not forfeit the land at the Common Law, and the reaſon is, becauſe that it is ſubject to the forfeiture of the Donees, and it is inconvenient, that the ſame land ſhould be ſubject to ſeveral forfeitures at the ſame time by ſeveral men, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bargainor and the Bargainees, and he ſaid, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that theſe uſes were begotten by fraud, as it appears in our books, ſee <hi>Chudleys caſe, Cook lib. 1.</hi> yet in ſo much, that without an expreſs Statute they were not forfeitable, by the ſame reaſon a truſt or confidence is not forfeitable (although they are begotten by fraud) without a ſpecial Act of Parliament: alſo in out caſe there are not any Badges of fraud, but only as a truſt betwixt the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainees, and that a bargain and truſt may be without fraud, although the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainor continue poſſeſſion againſt his Bargainee, which is another argument, that there is no fraud in the caſe, and the eſtates after made to the Tenants now in poſſeſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Lee &amp;c.</hi> for the Bargaines were not made by the appointment of the Bargainor, but of their own head: alſo he ſaid, that if here be any fraud, it is matter of fact, whereof the Iurors ought to have inquired, and the Iury here have found no fraud, and to prove that the fraud ought to be found by the Iury, he vouched <hi>Wardenfords caſe 2. &amp; 3.</hi> of <hi>Eliz.

Eliz. Dyer fo. 300.</hi> and no man can put off or be diſmiſſed of duties which belong to a ſubject, no more then he can put off his ſubjection, and this is the reaſon that an honor or dignitie intailed, ought to be forfeited, although it be intailed; for the honor which is given by the King hath a tacit condition in Law annexed unto it, and it ought not to continue in him who committeth Treaſon, nor in his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, although that the partie had but an eſtate tail therein; ſee <hi>Nevels caſe Cook lib. 7.</hi> and ſo had the King his licence, which is but a diſpenſation for the time, and countermandable by the King, and he ſaid, that the Book in <hi>2.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97330:26"/>of this bargain or not, and he ſaid, that it ſhall not be priviledged, for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance which is revokable at the will of the Bargainor is meerly fraudulent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any intereſt of forfeiture, for otherwiſe the Kings ſubjects are but as <hi>ferae naturae,</hi> which when they are out of their pale, the King had no means to reduce them, within the Park again; for in this caſe had no means directly to puniſh this offence upon the body of the offender, but by the depriving him of the means of his maintenance, and although there be no fraud here in the parties Bargainees, yet the fraud in the Bargainor makes the conveyance void againſt the King; for as it appeareth by our books, the King cannot be an inſtrument of fraud, although he may be party thereunto; ſee <hi>17.</hi> and <hi>21. E. 3.</hi> ſo in the caſe of an infant cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>Mountague,</hi> all which and many others to this purpoſe of fraud are cited in <hi>Farmors caſe Cook lib. 3. fo. 48.</hi> and whereas it was objected, that here can be no fraud intended in the offender, in regard he had a licence to travel, and it cannot be intended, that he preſuppoſed any countermand of this licence, and to commit a contempt by his refuſing to return, and ſo to ſave his lands by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, in reſpect this countermand is a thing whereof he could not have divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to that I anſwer, that the contempt ſubſequent is a ſufficient proof of ſuch precedent conjecture, and that the conveyance was made fraudulently to prevent the prejudice, which might accrew unto him by ſuch contempt, and this opinion will appear by the makers of the Statute of <hi>13. Eliz. cap. 3.</hi> and <hi>14. Eliz. cap. 6.</hi> made againſt fugitives, and may well be collected upon the peruſal of thoſe Statutes, and that the Iudges here ought to make ſuch conſtruction, upon the ſubſequent Act; he vouched the caſe of <hi>Doctor Ellis in Plowden,</hi> and <hi>Saunders caſe</hi> in the matters of the Crown, happening at <hi>Salop,</hi> by which caſes it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the Iudges proved the firſt intent by ſecondary Actions ſubſequent by way of diſcourſe, and therefore in <hi>Saunders</hi> caſe, the partie having an expreſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to poyſon his wife, delivered unto her a poyſoned apple, and the wife not knowing it to be poyſoned, gave it to her child, who died thereof: there the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment againſt <hi>Saunders</hi> was that of malice forethought &amp;c. he intended to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the child, although this was not his firſt intention, ſo in the other caſe there cited; if a man intend only the death of <hi>A.</hi> and being fighting with him, be a ſtranger interpoſeth himſelf to part the affray and he is ſlain, this is wilful mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, although here was no primer intent to kill <hi>B.</hi> but this is made an intention by legal collection; and ſo in our caſe, here is <hi>intentio Jegalis</hi> and not <hi>actualis,</hi> and yet aſwel unavoidable as any other; alſo although it hath been objected, that by the common Law none ſhall avoid a conveyance by reaſon of fraud, except he who hath a former intereſt, and the Statutes give no authoritie to any, but to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſors, upon valuable conſideration, yet I ſay, that the Statute of <hi>13.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97330:27"/>further, and vouched <hi>Goodales caſe Cook lib. 5.</hi> to prove that a Deed ſhall not be deemed to be good, except it be free from all fraud or clandeſtine agreement, as it was there reſolved, that the payment for performance of a condition was not good, as to ſtrangers, by reaſon of a precedent agreement, and <hi>Burrels caſe Cook lib. 6.</hi> where it appeareth, that no fraud ſhall be accounted <hi>bona fide,</hi> as to ſtrangers which is accompanied with truſt &amp;c. alſo although here is not any fraud expreſly found by the office, yet he thought, that the equity of the caſe appears plainly: and that it ſhall be for the King, and he vouched divers decrees in this Court to prove it, as <hi>43. Eliz. Howſe</hi> was outlawed and took divers bonds of <hi>Carne</hi> in the names of others his friends, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Marlow,</hi> and others in truſt; alſo took Statutes in their names in truſt, and it was decreed here, that the King ſhould have all, vy reaſon of the fraud, although it be not found by any office, and in <hi>Hoards caſe</hi> it was decreed here, that whereas the ſaid <hi>Hoard</hi> betwixt the years of <hi>25.</hi> and <hi>32.</hi> had ſent divers ſummes of money to <hi>Sheldon</hi> of <hi>Bealie,</hi> and had taken divers obligations, and other ſecurities of him in others names before his conviction, yet it was decreed to the King in this Court without any fraud found by office; and in Sir <hi>Walter Raughlies caſe</hi> the ſame year decreed in this Court, that whereas Sir <hi>Walter Raughlie</hi> being poſſeſſed of a tearm of <hi>100.</hi> years of <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> he having a determination to purchaſe the reverſion in fee of the ſame land, conveyed his Tearm to his eldeſt ſon to the intent it ſhould not be drowned; and therefore about <hi>40.

Firſt, we are in a Court of equitie by Engliſh Bill, where the Iudges are only to adjudge upon the fraud, and there they were in a Court of Law, and the fraud was the matter of fact, which ought to be expreſſy found by the Iury, as appears by the books. Secondly, in that caſe the Iury found expreſſy, that the conveyance was not by fraud to deceive the King of his wardſhip, but only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Creditors &amp;c. but in-our caſe there is no ſuch negative, and therefore it differeth much: ſee <hi>Dyer 267.</hi> and <hi>268.</hi> as to the finding in the negative: at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day in the ſame Term of <hi>Eaſter 7.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97330:28"/>
                        <hi>Bromley,</hi> to make the proceſs into a wrong County, it ſeemed that the Action ſhould lie againſt him only; but in regard it is ſhewed in the Declaration, that the ſaid ſuggeſtion was made by him in performance of the precedent agreement that the action lieth againſt both, which the Court granted. <hi>Godfrey</hi> in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moved in arreſt of judgement, and that for two cauſes, the action lieth not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter here, it appears by the <hi>4.

Hoes caſe fol. 19.</hi> according to this diverſitie, <hi>Tanfield</hi> chief Baron thought that the Plantiff ſhall recover; for firſt the writ of error here is not a writ, but a commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore falſe lattin ſhall not abate it, as it hath been adjudged in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi> chamber, and in this caſe the <hi>ſcire facias ad audiendum errores,</hi> and all the writ, and this <hi>ſcire facias</hi> in our caſe, ought to have been made againſt the ſaid <hi>Julian,</hi> as againſt a married woman, and the writ of execution, which is the warrant to the Sheriff is not in ſuch words as the judgement in the Kings Bench is upon which it is founded, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhould take the aforeſaid <hi>Julian</hi> &amp;c. but that he take the ſaid <hi>Julian Goddard,</hi> then the Sheriff ſhall not ſay in his defence, that all the proceeding in the writ of error was againſt the perſon, and aided himſelf by entrie in the roll of the Court, <hi>viz. quod praedict. Julianum capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at &amp;c.</hi> but he ought to rely only upon the writ, and if in this caſe he would ſave himſelf, then he ſhould have inquired upon the delivery of the writ unto him by <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies</hi> who was that <hi>Julian Goddard,</hi> and if thereupon <hi>Lovies</hi> had informed him, that it was <hi>Julian Doillie,</hi> then the Sheriff ſhould have an action upon the caſe againſt <hi>Lovies</hi> upon this falſe information, <hi>viz.</hi> if <hi>A.</hi> proſecute a replevin to reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy his Cattle, and thereupon he cauſe the Sheriff to deliver unto him the Cattle of <hi>B.</hi> for this here <hi>B.</hi> hath his remedy againſt the Sheriff, and the Sheriff againſt <hi>A.</hi> for this falſe information: alſo he ſaid, that if a <hi>fieri facias</hi> cometh to make execution of the goods of <hi>B.</hi> if the Sheriff take others goods in execution, a Treſpaſs lieth, and therefore to ſecure himſelf, he ought to impannel an inqueſt, to finde if they be the goods of <hi>B.</hi> or not, and then as he conceived it is good; but the opinion of the Iudges in the Kings Bench, in <hi>Mich. 5. Jac.</hi> in Treſpaſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Rookwood</hi> and <hi>Beal</hi> was to the contrary; for there a Treſpaſs was brought by <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and the Defendant juſtified the taking and ſo forth, as Sheriff by vertue of a <hi>fieri facias,</hi> as of the goods of <hi>Edward Rookwood</hi> father of the Plantiff, and upon the execution of this writ the Defendant impannelled a Iury, who found the goods to be the goods of the ſaid <hi>Edward Rookwook,</hi> for which &amp;c. the Plantiff in the replication Traverſed, that they were his goods <hi>abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que hoc</hi> that the Iury found, that they were the goods of <hi>Edward Rookwood &amp;c.</hi> whereby it ſeemeth that the finding of the Iury in this caſe is not material, and ſo the Court then conceived, therefore <hi>quaere</hi> the opinion of <hi>Tanfield</hi> chief Baron in that point; and ſee the <hi>17. <hi>E.</hi> 2. pl. 373. and 31.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97330:29"/>caſe an action lies againſt the Sheriff, if he take the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> in execution, for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not to him that it is the ſame perſon; but for the other cauſe, it ſeemeth that the Plantiff ſhall not have judgement, for the Sheriff is no ſuch perſon, who ought to be priviledged here, and therefore the Plantiff ſhould have his remedy elſe where, and he ſaid, that ſuch a caſe hath been reverſed in the <hi>Exehequer</hi> Chamber for error; for the under-Sheriff is but an Attorney for a partie privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that is for the Sheriff, but all the Clarks of the Court, and the other Barons were againſt him in that, and alſo all the preſidents. <hi>Altham</hi> Baron had never heard it argued before, and therefore he reſpited his opinion till another day, at which day he ſaid, that the arreſt is not juſtifiable, and ſo for the matter an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion well lieth, for by him the arreſt ought to be in this caſe with a ſpecial recital, that whereas judgement was given and ſo forth; as in the <hi>1.</hi> and <hi>2.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97330:30"/>matter for which the wife by poſſibility might have an action after the death of her husband, there they ought to joyn, and for this falſe impriſonment the wife may have an action after the death of her husband, and therefore they ought to joyn here. <hi>Snig</hi> and <hi>Bromley</hi> Barons, ſeemed <hi>prima facie,</hi> that the action lies well enough, when they joyn or when the husband alone bringeth it: and they vouched —and <hi>Doillies</hi> Councel ſaid, that they have heard it to be adjudged in the Kings Benth <hi>28.

Note, that <hi>Doillie</hi> perceiving the Law againſt him for this laſt point or matter, becauſe his wife did not joyn, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his action of new in this Court, and this was in Treſpas for the beating and impriſoning his wife, and in this caſe the husband and wife joyned, and declared to the damage of the husband and wife, and the like Plea was pleaded in Bar as was in the other action, and the record thereof was read in Court <hi>Termino Paſch. 9.

Secondly, they agreed by the admittance of <hi>Wikes</hi> his Councel, that the King as to the moity which came to him, ſhall not be ordered in equity to perform the truſt repoſed in <hi>Wintor,</hi> for the wife of the Leſſor, for the King cannot be ſeiſed to another mans uſe, no more can his eſtate be ſubject to any truſt at this day, as the Attorney general had ſaid clearly, which the Court granted: but <hi>Brock</hi> of Councel with <hi>Wikes</hi> ſeemed not to be ſatisfied, but that the King ought to execute ſuch truſt by equity; but <hi>Tanfield</hi> chief Baron ſaid, that before me at another day, you were content to be concluded, as to this point: that there is no equity againſt the King. Thirdly, it was debated, if in this caſe the King ſhould have the other moity, which was in <hi>Somerfield</hi> by equity, for clearly, if the leaſe had been made in truſt, for the benefit of the Leſſor himſelf, the King ſhould have it by his attainder, and then what difference, it being made for the benefit of the wife of the perſon attainted, for her husband might have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of it, being a truſt only of a Chattel as he might have done of a Chattel, whereof the wife was poſſeſſed, and he might have wholly releaſed this truſt, and by conſiquence he might forfeit it by his attainder; whereunto <hi>Snig</hi> and <hi>Altham</hi> Barons agreed, and by <hi>Bromley</hi> his releaſe ſhall binde but during his life: the Attorney general ſaid, that he might releaſe all. <hi>Brock</hi> it ſhould be miſchievous
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97330:30"/>that his releaſe of this truſt, ſhould bar the wife of her truſt after her husbands death; for admit that a man make a leaſe to <hi>A.</hi> to the uſe of his wife for <hi>100.</hi> years, if ſhe ſhall ſo long live, and this for a joynture for his wife, can her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band prejudice her of this joynture by releaſe of the truſt, as if he ſhould ſay no, and then <hi>à fortiori</hi> in the caſe here, for the truſt is for the wife and children, and the truſt for the children cannot be releaſed by the father, and conſequently not forfeited by him: by the Court there is no ſuch Bill depending before us, which demands any thing for the King, and the Bill which is here exhibited by <hi>Wikes</hi> prayes nothing but one moity of the term, <hi>viz.</hi> that which in Law belongs to <hi>Somerfield,</hi> which moity by the Common Law we cannot take from him, and therefore we will leave you to ſue in the office of Pleas, according to the courſe of the Common Law in the name of <hi>Somerfield;</hi> and therefore they gave no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, if by equity the husband ſhall forfeit a truſt, which he had for years in the right of his wife.</p>

Eliz.</hi> in <hi>Dyer 348.</hi> which as he ſaid proved the caſe expreſly, for there in ſuch a caſe it is adjudged, that the deviſee of the rent may after demand thereof diſtrain, and yet the heir may enter for the not payment of the rent, although it were never demanded, ſo that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent words of diſtraining do not qualifie the force of the condition, although there be there an expreſs condition, and in our caſe but a condition implyed, and he ſaid, that it ſeemed reaſonable, that ſuch a conſtruction for the diſtreſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition alſo ſhall ſtand, as appeareth by divers caſes, that upon ſuch words, the Law will allow a double remedy, and therefore he vouched <hi>Gravenors caſe</hi> in the Common Pleas, <hi>Hill. 36. Eliz. Rot. 1322.</hi> where a leaſe was made by <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> Colledge to husband and wife, ſo that if the husband alien that the leaſe ſhall be void, and provided that they do not make any under-tenants, and to this purpoſe he vouched the caſe of the Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> cited in the Lord <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels caſe, Cook lib. 2.</hi> where the words amounted to a covenant and a couditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and if this word paying ſhould not be conſtrued to be a condition, then it were altogether void and idle, and ſuch a conſtruction ought not to be made in a will, and he conceived, that this rent ought to be paid by the wife, without any demand upon the pain of the condition, and therefore he vouched <hi>22. H. 6. fo. 57.14. E. 4 21. E. 4.</hi> by <hi>Huſſey</hi> and <hi>18. Eliz. Dyer 348.</hi> vouched before, and ſo it was reſolved as he ſaid, in the Court of Wards in <hi>Somings caſe,</hi> where a man made a deviſe paying a rent to a ſtranger, this ought to be paid without demand, and he ſaid, that the Common caſe is proved, when a feofment is made upon condition that the feoffee ſhall do an act to a ſtranger, this ought to be done in convenient time without requeſt by the ſtranger; and ſo here it ſeemeth, although a demand ought to be made by the ſiſter, yet the wife ought to give notice to the ſiſter of the Legacy, ſo that ſhe may make a demand; and therefore he vouched <hi>Warder</hi> and <hi>Downings caſe,</hi> where a man deviſed, that his eldeſt ſon upon entry ſhould pay to the younger ſon ſuch a ſumme of money, here the eldes brother ought to give
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97330:32"/>notice at what time he will enter, to the intent that the younger brother may be provided to make a demand. <hi>Edwards</hi> of the Inner <hi>Temple</hi> contrary. Firſt, it ſeemeth, that by this limitation the wife ought to retain the land until the iſſue of the deviſor ſhould have come to the age of <hi>18.</hi> years, for this a time certain, and as it is conſtrued upon ſuch words in <hi>Boraſtons caſe, Cook lib. 3.</hi> that the Executors there have an intereſt certain, ſo it ſhould be conſtrued here, to refer to a certainty which is until the time by computation, that the iſſue ſhould have attained to <hi>18.</hi> years, and the rather in this caſe, in reſpect the deviſor had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſpoſed of the land until the ſon ſhould have accompliſhed the ſaid age. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it ſeemeth, that the wife hath an eſtate for life, not conditional, in ſo much as the words are not joyned in the caſe, the <hi>18. Eliz. Dyer</hi> hath been vouched: but that was upon an expreſs condition, but here it is by implication, and then the clauſe of diſtreſs taketh away the force of the implication, which otherwiſe might be thereupon inferred; and therefore in <hi>5. Eliz. Dyer</hi> it appeareth, that the word Proviſo annexed to other words makes it no condition in judgement of Law, and ſo in <hi>14. Eliz. Dyer 311.</hi> and he vouched alſo <hi>18. Eliz. Dyer Greens caſe,</hi> that if a man deviſeth lands to his friends, paying to his wife with a clauſe of diſtreſs, this is no condition as it is adjudged. Thirdly, it ſeemeth, that this ſumme to be paid to the ſiſter is a rent, and therefore ought to be demanded, or otherwiſe in judgement of Law, the condition ſhall not be broken, and the <hi>21. E. 4.</hi> the caſe of an obligation to perform covenants &amp;c. and a caſe between <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> and <hi>Wentworth 37. Eliz.</hi> that a demand ought to be made for a rent, which is granted in liew of Dower: for the wife brought a writ of Dower, for the land of her husband, the Tenant pleaded, that ſhe accepted a rent out of the land in liew of her Dower, and the wife replied, that the ſaid rent was granted upon condition, that if it were not paid at certain dayes, that it ſhould be void, and that ſhe ſhould have Dower of the land, and ſhe ſaid, that the rent was not paid at the dayes &amp;c. but ſhewed not in her pleading, any demand to be made, and therefore it was holden evil pleading, for ſuch a rent ought to be demanded, or otherwiſe the condition is not broken, and ſo here. <hi>Nota,</hi> that this caſe was appointed to be argued again, but after (as I heard) the Barons amongſt themſelves reſolved to give judgement for the Defendant upon one point only, which was, that the eſtate of the wife of the deviſor is not determined until the iſſue ſhould have come to the age of <hi>18.</hi> years, and ſo none of the other points came now in queſtion, and judgement was given as above-ſaid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nota,</hi> that in <hi>Mich. 6.

                           <item>Secondly, the acknowledgement of the leaſe before Commiſſioners, and the prayer of the Biſhop to have it inrolled, makes it not a record before inrolment, for it appears by the <hi>21. H. 7.</hi> that if the Sheriff by vertue of a writ doth any thing, yet it is no matter of Record, until it be returned, and ſo is the <hi>9th.</hi> of <hi>Ed. 4. fo. 96.</hi> that if the Phillizer of a County enter Proceſs of outlawry in the room of a Phillizer of another County, this is not a Record in judgement of Law, although that it be a thing recorded; and ſo he conceived, that it was no ſufficient Record in regard the Commiſſioners have not certified this recognizance, and the prayer of the Biſhop: Leſſor in the life of the Leſſee, and Leſſor whereby as he ſaid, he admitted, that if this were certified by the Commiſſioners in the life of the Leſſor and Leſſee, that then without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolment this had been a ſufficient record to intitle the Queen, who was Leſſee.</item>
                           <item>Thirdly, he argued that the inrolment ſubſequent in this caſe in time of the King that now is, maketh not the leaſe good, which was made to the Queen, for he thought that the interruptions hindred the operation of this leaſe (by interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) he meant the death of the Biſhop, Leſſor, and of the Queen Leſſee as it ſeemeth, and the leaſe in poſſeſſion of Sir <hi>Edward Dimock</hi> by force thereof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inrolment, and therefore he ſaid it was adjudged, if a man covenant to ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of his wife which ſhall be, and there he makes a leaſe of the land, and then takes a wife, this leaſe by him is ſuch an interruption, that the uſe ſhall not ariſe to the wife, but in <hi>Wintors caſe</hi> in <hi>Banco Regis 4.

H. 8</hi> of inrolments, doth not hinder the relation, for the words are, that nothing ſhall pals by the bargain (except the Deed be inrolled &amp;c.) ſo that if the Deed be inrolled in due time, it paſſeth from the beginning well enough, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it is in our caſe, ſee the <hi>12.

<list>
                           <item>Firſt, I conceive that nothing reſteth in the Queen without inrolment, but if Leſſee for years be outlawed, the King ſhall have this leaſe by the outlawry, for the outlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is intended to be upon Record, but of a wardſhip for land, that is not in the Queen, by the death of the Queens Tenant without an office, becauſe there is no matter of Record, if an Alien hath a leaſe of land this is forfeited, yet he ſhall have perſonal Chattels, and as to the Book of <hi>18.

Eriches caſe,</hi> it appears that an Act of Parliament will not revive a thing that is meerly dead, by reaſon of any inrolment, and much more here, an inrolment cannot revive this leaſe which is meerly void by the death of the Leſſor, and the entrance of the Leſſee of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſucceſſor, and there is a great difference betwixt the inrolment in this caſe, and the inrolment of a bargain and ſale, in regard that the ſale is dead before the inrolment, and yet in the caſe of bargain and ſale, it was adjudged in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas <hi>Paſch. 2. Jac.</hi> in Sir <hi>Thomas Lees caſe</hi> called <hi>Bellinghams caſe,</hi> that if a man bargain land to <hi>A.</hi> and before inrolment of the Deed <hi>A.</hi> bargaines the land to <hi>B.</hi> which ſecond bargain is inrolled, this inrolment makes not the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain good to <hi>B.</hi> for the relation of the firſt, is only to perfect and make good the conveyance to <hi>A.</hi> from all incumbrances after his bargain, but not to make the ſecond Deed good which was void before: alſo in <hi>36. Eliz.</hi> in Sir <hi>Thomas Smiths caſe,</hi> if the Bargainee ſuffer a recovery before the Deed inrolled, yet that doth not make the recovers good, and he ſaid, that in this caſe, until an inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the leaſe made to the Queen there is no Leſſee, and a leaſe cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Leſſor and Leſſee, and before an inrolment of the leaſe, the Leſſor is dead, ſo that there never was a Leſſor and Leſſee in life together and therefore the incep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this leaſe was altogether imperfect before the conſummation came, and ſo it leemeth by him, that the death of the Biſhop Leſſor intervening before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolment is the principal cauſe, that the firſt leaſe is not good: as to the <hi>4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
                        </hi> point of confirmation, it ſeems to me, in regard that the Biſhop was ſeiſed in right of his Biſhoprick, and the Dean and Chapter have no intereſt in the land, ſo that an aſſent is only ſufficient in this caſe, it ſeems to me, that the confirmation (as you call it) is good enough, for it is clear, that an aſſent may be aſwell before the leaſe as after, for it paſſeth no intereſt no more then an Attornment. <hi>Cook lib. 5. Foords caſe</hi> proveth this diverſity plainly, and by the ſame reaſon, alſo it ſeems to me, that this aſſent of parties who have no intereſt is good enough without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolment, but otherwiſe it ſhould be, if a confirmation were required in the caſe: and as to the pleading, I think the Bar is good; and as to the exceptions which have been made, <hi>viz.</hi> if the leaſe ſuppoſed to be made to the Queen be anſwered, and he ſaid, it was good enough, for the purpoſe of the Defendant is to bring the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97330:35"/>matter in Law before the Iudges, and the matter in Law is, if it were any leaſe or not, as the information ſuppoſeth, and therefore the Defendant ought not to agree with the information for the matter in Law, and therefore he had done well to ſhew the ſpecial matter as he had done, and not to confeſs it as it is in the in formation, nor to traverſe the ſaid demiſe, becauſe it is matter in Law: <hi>5.

Parkhal</hi> are well ſatisfied. <hi>Harris</hi> Serjeant ſaid, that the caſe is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to the point in <hi>Carter</hi> and <hi>Ringſteeds</hi> caſe, concrrning the Mannor of <hi>Odiam,</hi> where a man was ſeiſed of of a Mannor within which the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> did lie, and is parcel thereof, and he by his will deviſed the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mannor of <hi>Odiam,</hi> where the Mannor paſſeth by the deviſe, and is not excepted. <hi>Snig</hi> and <hi>Altham</hi> Barons agreed, that this proves the caſe in equity, but by the chief Baron <hi>Tanfield,</hi> becauſe this is a rare caſe, that we ſhould reverſe or undo a decree made by our predeceſſors in the very point decreed by them, it is good to be adviſed, and therefore they directed <hi>Arden</hi> to finde preſidents if he could, by ſearch made for them in the ſaid caſe, and therefore the Attorney gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral who was of Councel for <hi>Darcie,</hi> had demurred upon the Bill which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97330:38"/>by <hi>Arden,</hi> and that he being not preſent, day was given until another term to hear Councel on both parts, at which day the Attorney ſaid, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it a ſtrange caſe, and without preſident, that a Court ſhould impeach and reverſe the decrees given in the ſame Court, and that if it ſhould be ſuffered, the ſubjects would be vexed and troubled without any end or quiet, and this ſtands with the gravity of every Court to maintain their own judgements, and therefore ſeveral Statutes were made to reverſe judgements upon erroneous proceedings, and judges of other Courts conſtituted to examine them, which proveth, that before the Statutes aforeſaid, and without aid of them the Iudges would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe their own Iudgements, and ſo here. <hi>Harris</hi> to the contrary, it is not without preſidents, that in a Court of equity one, and the ſame decree in the ſame Court hath been reverſed by decree of the ſame Court, upon ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had of the erroneous miſpriſions of Law, and it is no diſhonour to a Court of juſtice ſo to do for matter in Law, but otherwiſe it were for matter of fact, for then that betrayeth an Ignorance in the Iudges, which would be a diſhonour to the Court, but for Law men are not Angles, and for that point, there may be errour; to prove that the Court of equity may do ſo, he vouched the Book of <hi>27.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97330:39"/>the reaſon is, becauſe a Lay perſon did not know his ſufficiency peradventure at the firſt, but a Spiritual perſon by intendment may inform himſelf thereof wel enough, and therefore he vouched <hi>18.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97330:41"/>for this falſe recitall, and according he vouched <hi>Alton Woods caſe, Cook L. 1.</hi> and in our caſe it is prejudiciall to the Queen, that all the intereſt in the former leaſe is not ſurrendred, but a part thereof is in <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> for the Queen intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that all this Land now leaſed ſhould be immediately lyable to her rent newly reſerved, where in deed it cannot be ſo here, untill the antient leaſe be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereby, &amp;c. this recitall is tacitely intended part of the conſideration: For the ſecond Point, it ſeemeth that here is a falcity in the conſideration expreſſed, for the Queen leaſed to <hi>Hitchmore</hi> as well for <hi>30</hi> l. as for that, that he aſſumed to build and ſuſtaine, ſo that the aſſumpſit to build and ſuſtain is part of the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and therein the Queen is deceived, and to prove that the word <hi>(pro)</hi> is as good as if it had been in conſideration, he vouched <hi>43. Eliz.

Altonwoods caſe, Cooks lib. 1. fo. 43.</hi> and in our caſe the conſideration is of a thing beneficiall to the King to be performed, therefore the falcity much more avoids the Grant: Alſo the Covenant found here to be made doth not aide the matter at all, for it is not proper to be called a Covenant in Letters Patents, becauſe he did not ſeale unto it, and it cannot be called his deed, but yet ſhall be bound thereunto for his eſtate, but not by way of action, as the conſideration intends. Alſo it ſeemeth, notwithſtanding the conſtruction here was, that in conſideration the Leſſee would repaire, &amp;c. yet as our caſe is, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is void, becauſe it is not repaired according, as appears by <hi>Barwicks caſe, Cook lib. 5. fo. 94.</hi> that if the conſideration in the caſe of the King be not duly performed; and that prejudice may accrew to the King, by reaſon of the not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof, this avoids the Patent. Alſo if the caſe be ſo, this would be an eſtate conditionall between common perſons, <hi>38. H. 6. and the 6. E: 6. Dyer, 72. and 21. E. 4. by Huſſey pro quod Relaxabit, &amp;c. and ſo in Sir Thomas Wrothes caſe, Plowden, and 15. <hi>E.</hi> 4</hi> for the King had no other remedy to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the thing to be done, except to ſeiſe the land for the not performance, &amp; therefore it appears by <hi>21.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97330:41"/>to plead this conſideration to be performed on his part, which alſo appears by Sir <hi>Thomas Wrothes caſe,</hi> if it be of a thing Executory, and ſo for all theſe cauſes I pray that Iudgement may be given for the Plantiffe. <hi>Crook George</hi> at another day argued to the contrary, and he anſwered three points.

                        </hi> for in theſe Books it appears, that the King is deceived both in point of ſuggeſtion, and in point of intereſt, but our caſe is not upon a falſe ſuggeſtion, which doth prejudice the King in intereſt, and in our caſe the King expreſſeth another thing to be the Conſideration of his grant, and the ſuggeſtion is not the conſideration, and therefore there is a great diverſity, and to warrant this to be a material diverſitie, he vouched the Rule of the caſe in <hi>21. E. 4. fo. 49.</hi> in Sir <hi>Thomas Wrothes</hi> caſe in <hi>Plowden,</hi> for in <hi>21. E. 4.</hi> it is agreed, that the miſ-recital that it was the Kings free Chappel, is not material for the King, is not deceived in point of intereſt, and although that the book <hi>3. H. 7. fo. 6.</hi> is that if the King relaſe to a Prior a Corody, becauſe that the Priory was of the Kings foundation, whereas it was of another mans foundation, and therefore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe ſhould be void, becauſe of the falſitie, although that it be a falſitie in the conſideration, and ſo more ſtrong then in our caſe, yet in the ſaid caſe, it was adjudged to be a good releaſe, as appears in <hi>Plowden 331.</hi> put in the caſe of Mines, and ſo is <hi>3. H. 7. fo. 7.</hi> and that this is not Law; ſee <hi>Altonwoods</hi> caſe <hi>Cook lib. 1.</hi> accordingly, and as to the book <hi>15. E. 3.</hi> there cited, he did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree unto it, for if the King hath the title to preſent, and he preſenteth one not according to this title, this preſentation is void: ſee <hi>Greens</hi> caſe in the Kings Bench <hi>44. Eliz.</hi> accordingly, and now reported by the Lord <hi>Cook lib. 6. fo. 29.8. H. 7. fo. 3.</hi> if the King grant the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> of the value of <hi>10.</hi> l. and this is of the value of <hi>20.</hi> the King is deceived in the matter of value by the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the party, and therefore the grant is void, which was agreed in point of judgement in the Kings Bench <hi>2. lac.</hi>—between <hi>Maſon</hi> and <hi>Chambers,</hi> but there it was adjudged, that if the King will grant to <hi>A.</hi> the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> which Mannor is of the value of <hi>10.</hi> l. yearly whereas it is worth <hi>20.</hi> l. yet the Grant is good, becauſe the words which Mannor is worth &amp;c. are words but of the Kings recital, and in our caſe here is but one expreſs Conſideration, and therefore the recital is not material, ſee <hi>37. H. 8. Brook Patents 100.</hi> that book maketh a <hi>quaere,</hi> if a falſe conſideration doth not avoid a Patent aſwell as falſe ſuggeſtion, but the book upon which I do principally relie, is a point reſolved in the principal caſe of <hi>Altonwood, Cook lib. 1. fo. 45.</hi> or <hi>43.</hi> where the King recites that he had made a leaſe to <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> and that whereas they had ſurrendred the Patent of the ſaid leaſe, he in conſideration of the ſaid ſurrender makes a new leaſe to <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> here although, that in fact the demiſe ſuppoſed in the recital to be made to <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> was void, and ſo the King was deceived in the matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital, yet in reſpect that he made the ſurrender of the Patent to be the ſole conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his grant, the falſitie of his recital is not material, for the Iudges ought to take it to be a Motive to the King in his Grant, which he did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to be a Motive, eſpecially if he expreſs another Motive, and ſo in our caſe: alſo it ſhould be greatly miſchievous to <hi>Hitchmore,</hi> if this falſitie of the recital ſhould prejudice him, for by intendment it is not in his power to inform the King of this leaſe, which was made by <hi>Burwel</hi> to <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> becauſe he is a ſtranger unto it, and alſo the leaſe is not upon Record, and therefore <hi>Hitchmore</hi> is not bound to take notice of it; ſee temps <hi>H. 8. Brook,</hi> Action upon the caſe &amp;c.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97330:42"/>and alſo the leaſe here made by <hi>Burwel</hi> to <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> is to have continuance but for <hi>8.</hi> years after the time of the commencement of the new leaſe made to <hi>Hitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> and ſo the King then ſhall have it liable to his rent newly reſerved, and ſo in theſe circumſtances our caſe differs in matter of prejudice, from <hi>Barwicks caſe Cook lib. 5.</hi> for there the Kings Leſſee made divers under Leſſees for all his Term, and after he himſelf by fraud accepted a new leaſe of all rendring rent, which new leaſe was in conſideration expreſly of a ſurrender of the firſt demiſe, and of all the eſtate &amp;c. and this leaſe was there void, and ſo the diverſitie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, alſo in <hi>18. Eliz. Dyer 352.</hi> where the deceipt to the Queen was in point of expreſs conſideration, and yet the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> ſaid, that in that caſe the grant was not void, , and then much more in our caſe; but admitting that the leaſe ſhould not be good, notwithſtanding this falſe recital, yet it hath been objected, that the conſideration is not performed according to the Kings intention, for the words of the leaſe are, know yee now, aſwel for a fine of <hi>30</hi> l. as for that, that <hi>Hitchmore</hi> had aſſumed to repair the Mills at his coſts and charges &amp;c. and that here the ſaid <hi>Hitchmore</hi> had not aſſumed by Record, ſo that the King may have any remedy againſt him, for his not repairing, and that the contract is no aſſurance: it ſeems to me that the words, for that, that he aſſumed, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Covenant was ſufficient to ſatisfie the intent of the Conſideration, for the words are, the words of the King, and of the Patentee, alſo in judgement of Law, and therefore <hi>Paſch 7. Iac</hi> the Lord <hi>Evers</hi> and <hi>Stricklands caſe</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, the Lord <hi>Evers</hi> had made a leaſe by Patent, in which theſe words were contained, <hi>viz.</hi> and the aforeſaid Leſſee ſhall repair the aforeſaid Tenement, and that after the reverſion was granted to the Lord <hi>Evers,</hi> and it was adjudged, that the Lord <hi>Evers</hi> ſhould have a Covenant againſt the Leſſee, and this was in the Kings Bench, <hi>Paſch. 7. Iac.</hi> and ſo here for that he had aſſumed upon himſelf, it is an accord ſufficient to teſtifie his promiſe, whereupon the King may have remedy to compel a reparation to be made, and although that the words are not perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken by the Leſſee, yet he ſhall be bound to perform them, as it is in <hi>38. E. 3. fo. 8.</hi> if one takes benefit by a leaſe which he never ſealed unto, yet he ſhall be bound to a <hi>nomine penae</hi> therein contained, and beſides here is an expreſs Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and therefore, &amp;c. Thirdly, it hath been objected, that the eſtate is conditional by theſe words, he hath aſſumed to repaire, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is not performed, and ſo the leaſe made to <hi>Hitchmore</hi> void, and <hi>38. H. 6.34.</hi> and <hi>35.</hi> hath been vouched in proofe, which book I do agree, for there the King had no other remedy to have his intent performed, and alſo the words there, are <hi>ad intentionem</hi> doth not make the eſtate conditional, and he vouched <hi>Brook</hi> condition <hi>96.</hi> and <hi>43. E. 3.34.</hi> and <hi>Perkins 144.</hi> that if the Queen give land, and that the Donee ſhould not Amortize, that makes not the eſtate conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal for the Amortizing, and ſo if a man make a feofment to <hi>A.</hi> that he ſhould pay <hi>10.</hi> l. and that <hi>R.</hi> may enter for non-payment, yet this maketh not a Condition, the reaſon is, becauſe the firſt words leaves it to the libertie of the feoffee, and the words after ſhall not be conſtrued to make it conditional, but I agreed the caſe put in Sir <hi>Thomas Wrothes</hi> caſe in <hi>Plowden, Pro eo quod relaxabit,</hi> that this makes a condition if it be not performed, becauſe it is of a thing, futurely to be done, or Executory, and the King had no other remedy; alſo in our caſe the circumſtances manifeſt, that the Kings intent was not to make a conditional eſtate upon this leaſe, for he accepted an expreſs Covenant for the requiring, and he vouched the Lord <hi>Cromwels</hi> caſe, in <hi>Cook lib. 2. fo. 72.</hi> and he ſaid, that if here the leaſe had been made to <hi>Hitchmore,</hi> in reſpect he had agreed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his rent, and further had a clauſe of diſtreſs for the rent, it ſhall not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that the King in ſuch caſe purpoſed to make the leaſe conditional, if the increaſe be not paid, becauſe he had provided himſelfe a diſtreſs, wherein although that the King had no more remedy, then by the Law he ſhould have had without theſe words, yet the words manifeſt his intent
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97330:42"/>to have no other remedy but the diſtreſſe, ſee <hi>7. E. 6. fo. 79. and 3. <hi>E.</hi> 6. Dyer, Non licebit alienare</hi> makes no condition in the caſe of the King without the words <hi>ſubpaena foris facturae,</hi> and he vouched, <hi>4. Ma. Dyer 138.</hi> the Counteſſe of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyes</hi> caſe, and alſo <hi>18. Eliz. Dyer 348.</hi> which as he ſaid, was one <hi>Greens caſe,</hi> where it was adjudged. that if the King provide himſelf of another remedy, the words by reaſon of any implications ſhall never be conſtrued to be conditionall, and ſo was the opinion of <hi>Manwood and Harper in Wellock and Hamonds caſe cited in Barraſtons caſe, Cook lib. 3. and 31, <hi>E.</hi> 1. Voucher 141.</hi> A man made a Feoffement with warranty againſt all people rendring rent, and further willed that if the Feoffee could not enjoy the land, that he ſhould pay no rent, here the words ſubſequent take away the force of a recovery in value, which the warranty otherwiſe would have given, and ſo here the King had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the remedy which he intended to have, and therefore it ſhall not be conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be conditionall, becauſe the conſideration intended is executed, <hi>viz.</hi> that he hath aſſumed, &amp;c. <hi>Dyer 76. and 44. Eliz.</hi> in the Kings Bench, Sir <hi>William Lees caſe,</hi> in conſideration that he had aſſumed to make a releaſe another promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to pay him <hi>10 l.</hi> an action may be brought for the <hi>10</hi> l. without averment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the releaſe, becauſe the conſideration is a thing executed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Aſſumpſit, &amp;c. but if Executory, then the Grant is conditionall, as <hi>9. E. 4.19. &amp; 15. E. 4.9.</hi> If an Annuity be granted <hi>pro concilio impendendo,</hi> this makes the Grant conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall, and void for not giving counſell, but otherwiſe it is if it be <hi>pro conſilio im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſo,</hi> 4. But admitting that here it was conditionall, yet the Queen cannot avoid it without Office, and ſo the Plaintiff had no title to enter for an avoidance which was before his grant, and ſo the leaſe is in <hi>eſſe</hi> at the time of the Grant made to the Plaintiff, your Grant is without recitall thereof, and therefore is void, ſee <hi>Knights caſe Coo. lib. 5.</hi> If there be a condition to re-enter for non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an Office ought to be found, but if it be upon condition to ceaſe for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment, then it is void to the King without Office, as it was agreed in this Court in Sir <hi>Moyle Finches caſe,</hi> and he vouched <hi>Cook lib. 1. Altonwoods caſe,</hi> to prove that the leaſe ought to be recited in the Grant of the reverſion, or future intereſt, and here although there be a <hi>non abſtante</hi> in your Patent, this doth not aid you, becauſe it is not found in the ſpeciall Verdict: Alſo for another cauſe the Plaintif ſhall not have judgement here, for it is not found that the Queen died ſeiſed, neither that it came to the King that now is, and ſo it cannot come to the Plaintiff, and although a fee-ſimple ſhall be intended to continue in the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet without ſhewing it ſhall not be intended to come to the heir, <hi>7. H. 7. 3.</hi> and ſo he prayed judgement for the Defendant. <hi>Tanfield chief Baron</hi> ſaid, that the caſe here is by Verdict, &amp; therefore we ought to intend ſuch circumſtances, if they be not expreſſed to the contrary: alſo the ſeiſin of the Queen is ſhewed to be in <hi>Jure Coronae,</hi> and therefore the intendment that it may be deviſed by diſſeiſin, or abatement between common perſons holdeth not here.</p>

Then it hath been granted, and the Law is ſo, that if an Executor recover a debt, which was due to the Teſtator, and hath judgement for it, now if you will have an action upon this judgement, this ought to be in the <hi>detinet,</hi> becauſe it is a legall purſuance of a thing given to the Teſtator, and not voluntary as a bond for further ſecurity or aſſurance, and ſo here the Bayl being purſuant and compulſory, but by <hi>5. E. 3.</hi> if it be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, then it ought to be put in the Kings Bench to an Executor which is to be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97330:43"/>reſembled to our caſe, if an Executor bring debt upon a Bayl, it ought to be as Executor, and not as I. S. cleerely: <hi>Altham</hi> the Bayl in the Kings Bench is upon the originall ſuit, and ſo it is not here, wherefore, &amp;c. to which it was not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, but for that matter it was adjourned, ſee <hi>H. 6.</hi> in the Kings Bench, if a Feme, &amp;c. take Husband, and one of the Debtors of the Teſtator promiſe the husband if he will forbear his ſuite to pay the debt, if the Husband will commence his action upon this promiſe, it ought to be in the name of his Wife alſo, becauſe the action purſueth the Originall debt. <hi>Williams</hi> contr. it was agreed that if the Law were ſuch, that the Action ought to be in the <hi>detinet</hi> only, then the bringing of it in the <hi>debet</hi> and <hi>detinet</hi> is ſuch a Ieofaile as is not aided by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>18.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97330:44"/>therefore upon the whole matter it is a diſcontinuance, but admitting that here was no diſcontinuance, it ſeemeth that the plea was good; and I agree, that in all caſes of Pleas iſſuable, the plea ought to be expreſly ſhewed; or that which Tantamounts, and here is ſhewed that which Tantamounts, for when the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe in his Action had ſhewed the names of the Mannors, and the Towns in which the acres lies, then the Venue to try it for every parcel ſhall come <hi>de vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neto</hi> from all together, and by conſequence it is reaſonable, that the Venue for the trial of one particular to be parcel, or not parcel ſhall come from all, for if the plea in this caſe were, that the Plantiff hath entred into the premiſes, this had been good, and then if it be good for the general, it ſeemeth it ſhould be good for every particular; alſo it is clear that two may be parcel of all the three Mannors, as in this caſe it is admitted to be parcel of all the premiſes by the demurrer if ſo &amp;c. <hi>Coventry,</hi> the plea here is not good, for the plea is to the writ, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ought to be purſuant to the premiſes of the plea, or otherwiſe the plea is not good <hi>36.

Firſt, this plea although it is but to the writ, yet it is peremptory as other pleas to writs are: ſee <hi>l. 5. E. 4. fol.</hi>—as to the concluſion of the plea, it is but matter of form, which the Clark ought to amend, and therefore upon your general demurrer, you ſhall not take advantage of it, and by the Court, this is but matter of form, and not being alledged for one of the ſpecial cauſes agreed, that notwithſtanding the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer be ſpecial, yet the Court ought to apply the concluſion alwayes as the matter of pleading will bear it, and therefore if a man plead to the Iuriſdiction of the Court, and demand judgement of the writ, yet it is good by <hi>Newton 7. H. 6.</hi> for if the Bar be good, the writ is not maintainable, and it was ſaid by <hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in a caſe in the Kings Bench <hi>34.

                           <item>Secondly, one &amp;c. will ſerve to ſupplie the defect in matter of form as here, and as to the Objection that the plea is not good, becauſe no certaintie is ſhewed where the entrie was; it ſeems to me the plea therein is good, becauſe here is no need in our caſe to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the certainty in the Declaration, for here by our plea we offer two things iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>viz.</hi> the entrie, or not entrie.</item>
                        </list> Secondly, if it be parcel of the premiſes, or not, and when divers things iſſuable are ſpecified, it is not neceſſary to ſhew the place of any, for it is time enough to ſhew it in the rejoynder. <hi>3. H. 7.11.3. H. 6.8.41. E. 3.8.10. H. 6.1.14.

Secondly, here a place is ſufficiently ſhewed by awarding of a <hi>venire facias,</hi> for it is certain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſhew it to be parcel of the Mannors, as it was reſolved in <hi>Bailies</hi> caſe <hi>Trin. 7.

H. 6.15.</hi> three ſeveral places are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and one pleaded a deed dated at the place aforeſaid, it is not good: alſo here it ſeemeth, if the party will plead, and not demur, the want of place ought to be ſhewed in the rejoynder, as it hath been conceived on the other ſide, but if he will not replie, but demur upon the Bar, the plea in Bar is not good: <hi>Trin. 40.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97330:45"/>the moitie of the Mannor of <hi>Caversfield</hi> rendring rent, and that this rent was arrear, and thereupon an Inquiſition returned, and a <hi>ſcire facias</hi> iſſued to <hi>Moil,</hi> who occupied the land, to ſhew cauſe wherefore the King ſhould not have this land, whereupon he pleaded as Ter-tenant, and upon this plea the Kings Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney demurred, but it was miſentred as ſee hereafter, but for divers great imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections aſwell in the Kings Commiſſion as otherwiſe, the Defendant ought to have judgement as all the Barons agreed, as by the arguments of every Baron upon mature deltheration appeareth, but for the reaſons of the Barons to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions taken by the Councel, ſee after for they are very good. <hi>Bromley</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſue Baron, whereas the Inquiſition purporteth, that the Iurors in the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> have found a foundation of a Priory in the County of <hi>Oxon.</hi> that is not good by courſe of Law, for if a thing be local, the Iurors of another County cannot finde it, and here the Commiſſion giveth power only to inquire of things in the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> and he vouched <hi>Plowden</hi> in the Earl of <hi>Leiceſters caſe</hi> upon a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, directed to <hi>White</hi> Lord and Maior &amp;c. alſo the Inquiſition is, that <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Banbury Nuper</hi> Prior was ſeiſed, and made a conveyance: as is affirmed, that is not good: alſo the word <hi>Nuper</hi> may be intended a <hi>100.</hi> years before, and ſo no certainty as appears in <hi>Wrotheſly</hi> and <hi>Adams</hi> caſe in <hi>Plowden: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> 2d. Baron, there are three faults in the Commiſſion. Firſt, is to inquire of a Mannor and lands of the late Priory of <hi>Biſter</hi> in <hi>Caversfield,</hi> in the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> and by theſe words, no power is given to inquire of any thing concerning the Priory which is in the County of <hi>Oxon.</hi> and the words in the County of <hi>Bucks</hi> do defer to all the ſentence precedent, and not to the word <hi>Caversfield</hi> only, <hi>19 E. 4. fo. 16 7. H. 6. fo. 8.</hi> if <hi>A. B.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> be inſula <hi>de D.</hi> it ſhall be conſtrued that the word <hi>inſula</hi> hath reference to all the three Towas, but if it were in <hi>A. B.</hi> and <hi>C. inſula,</hi> and not in <hi>inſula,</hi> then it is otherwiſe, a Commiſſion to inquire of lands of the Prior of <hi>Biſter</hi> is evil without queſtion where <hi>Biſter</hi> is, and he ſaid that this may be proved by <hi>Pages</hi> caſe <hi>Cook lib. 5.</hi> alſo the Commiſſion doth not propoſe any end wherefore the Iury ſhould be, but generally to inquire of the lands of the Priory at the time of the diſſolution, ſo that it may be certified to the King by the Inquiſition: the firſt fault which is found is, that the Priory was founded by the name of the Church of Saint <hi>Mary,</hi> and Saint <hi>Egbert</hi> without ſaying the Prior and Covent of &amp;c. and without finding of the place of the foundation, <hi>viz. Biſter,</hi> and this cannot be without aſſignmend of the place of the foundation, <hi>viz. Biſter:</hi> alſo the finding is, that one <hi>Thomas Banbury</hi> then Prior as is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, made a feofment &amp;c. and this is not good, becauſe it ought to be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found, or otherwiſe it is not material: alſo the intent of the feofment is found to be made by the Prior, but no livery is found thereupon, as it ought, although that livery ſhall be intended in the caſe of a feofment pleaded by a common perſon, yet it ought to be found expreſly, in the caſe of a Corporation, and the finding here, and that by vertue whereof he was ſeiſed, as the Law requireth doth not aide the caſe. <hi>Snig</hi> Baron, it ſeems to me, that this Commiſſion was only to inform, if the matter had been ſufficient to us to give judgement to the King, but here being to intitle, &amp;c. it is not good, the Commiſſion is to inquire for the King of the lands of the Prior, and this meerly incertain without ſaying certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of what Prior, and therefore they have no power to inquire of the lands of the Priory: alſo the Iury of the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> cannot inquire of the name of the foundation of a Corporation in the County of <hi>Oxon.</hi> for the foundation is matter Local, but it ſeems to me here, that the finding by vertue whereof he was ſeiſed <hi>prout, &amp;c.</hi> ſhall be intended that livery was made being by a verdict. <hi>Tanfield</hi> chief Baron, here is not any demurrer being miſ-entred, and therefore we have power to proceed to any matter in Law, for the purpoſe in this caſe was, that whereas the Statute of the <hi>27. H. 8.</hi> of leſſer Monaſteries under the yearly value of <hi>200. l.</hi> giveth them to the King, and this Mannor of <hi>Caversfield</hi> within this Statute is to be ſeiſed as is pretended in this caſe, whereupon this Commiſſion
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97330:45"/>iſſued to inform the King of this Mannor as parcel of theſe Revenues, for I deny that it is an office of intitling, it is only an office of inſtruction, for the Statute of <hi>27. H. 8.</hi> diſſolves the ſmaller Monaſteries, and veſts them actually in the King, and this is the difference from the Statute of the <hi>31. H. 8.</hi> for this Statute is only an Act to Aboliſh the lands of diſſolved Monaſteries, and therefore this Statute is only to inform, for the Statute of <hi>27. H. 8.</hi> had intitled the King, and he ſaid, that the land ſhall be in the King without office, ſo that it being but an office of inſtruction, this may be good, notwithſtanding divers incertainties therein contained; but the plain and apparant fault herein is, becauſe it is not to inquire what lands the Prior had at the time of the diſſolution, as it ought to be, for the words are to inquire what lands the late Prior had, but it ſeems to me in this caſe, that the Iurors of the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> may inquire of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in another County without doubt, this being but to inform and not to intitle, and this is not alike miſchief to the party, for otherwiſe all Commiſſions to inform would be quaſhed, and I have ſeen a Record in this Court, where a man of a good family was found to be the Kings Villain regardant to a Mannor in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> and this was done by a Iury in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and therefore in ſuch caſes (God defend) but that a Iury may finde a matter local in another County: alſo a groſs defect is in the Inquiſition, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it doth not mention that the Mannor of <hi>Caversfield</hi> came to the King by the Statute of the <hi>27. H. 8.</hi> but that the Priory came to the King by that Statute, and doth not ſay, that this Mannor was part of the poſſeſſions of the Priory at the time of diſſolution, and for theſe laſt matters it is apparent, that the Inquiſition, and Commiſſion are vitious, although it be not proper for us, as the caſe is to adjudge it, for here is no demurrer joyned, for the demurrer is joyned, as if it were upon an Information of intruſion, and here is no intruſion laid to the charge of the Defendant, and yet after the plea pleaded by <hi>Moil,</hi> the Attorney prayed that he may be convicted of the intruſion, and <hi>Moil</hi> ſaid, that he ought to ſhew matter ſufficient, whereupon he upon the intruſion aforeſaid ought to be convicted, ſo that a thing is demanded of us to give out judgement in which is not in queſtion before us, and therefore no judgement at all may be given here, wherefore it is not needful for us to diſpute other matters in the caſe, and as to the queſtions in Law, which were argued by <hi>George Crook,</hi> and others, <hi>Tanfield</hi> chief Baron, nor <hi>Altham</hi> ſpoke not at all, becauſe they might come before them again to be adjudged upon a better office: but <hi>Bromley</hi> and <hi>Snig</hi> Barons ſpoke to the matters in Law, and their opinions were as follow, and upon the plea of <hi>Moil</hi> the caſe was this, that the Tenant pleaded <hi>proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> that the Priory of <hi>Biſter</hi> was not founded by the name of the Priory of Saint <hi>Mary,</hi> and Saint <hi>Egbert</hi> of <hi>Biſter,</hi> as the inquiſition ſuppoſeth, for plea he ſaith; that one <hi>Thomas Banbury</hi> Prior of the Church of Saint <hi>Mary,</hi> and Saint <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> of <hi>Biſter</hi> infeoffed him of the Mannor of <hi>Caversfield</hi> by the name of the Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Mannor of <hi>Caversfield,</hi> as alſo by the name of all his lands and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>Caversfield,</hi> and that the ſaid feofment was made by the name of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of Saint <hi>Egbert</hi> of <hi>Biſter,</hi> and that it was known aſwel by the name of Saint <hi>Egbert</hi> as Saint <hi>Mary,</hi> and that the Mannor of <hi>Caversfield</hi> was well known by the name of the Moity of the Mannor of <hi>Caversfield,</hi> and that the Prior had no other land in <hi>Caversfield,</hi> and ſhewed alſo, that there is another in <hi>Caversfield,</hi> which is called <hi>Langſtons</hi> Mannor, the which heretofore was the Priors, and allotted as a Moitie of a Mannor, in the ſame Mannor of <hi>Caversfields,</hi> and thoſe and other circumſtances he uſed in his plea to the intent to ſhew, that all the land of the Prior ſhall paſs to him, and he ſhewed that this Mannor ſold to him was known by the name of <hi>Langſtons</hi> Mannor. <hi>Bromley</hi> Baron, the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is miſ-named in the Grant, becauſe it is a thing material, <hi>viz.</hi> the omiſſion of the word Saint <hi>Mary,</hi> for the name of aſſent in a body politick is, as the name of Baptiſme in a body natural, and the name of Baptiſme cannot be miſſnamed, as it appears <hi>3.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97330:46"/>this ſhall not binde him if he doth not admit it, and therefore it ſhall not conclude the King, ſee the <hi>11. Eliz. Dyer 279.</hi> where in ſome caſes the eſtate ſhall paſs by livery and ſeiſin, by what name ſoever it be made, but a Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot paſs an eſtate from them, but by Charter, and it may be conceived, that the founder intended two things; the one was Religion, or more properly ſuperſtition, the other was, that it may remain to poſterity, as a Monument of the piety of his Anceſtors, and then if the name ſhould be altered, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance would alſo decay, and therefore what name ſoever is firſt impoſed, ought alwayes to be obſerved: and that the omiſſion of Saint is material, and he vouched <hi>Eaton</hi> Colledge caſe, <hi>3.</hi> and <hi>4. Ma. Dyer</hi> and <hi>35. H. 6.31.</hi> the caſe of the foundation of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul &amp;c.</hi> but he agreed the caſe in <hi>11. Eliz. Dyer 278.</hi> that omiſſion of the word undivided is not prejudicial, becauſe no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial variance. Secondly, it ſeemed, that all the Priors Mannor of <hi>Cavers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> paſſed by this grant, for by <hi>20. H. 6.</hi> and <hi>22. H. 6.</hi> it appears, that a feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>20.</hi> Acres by the name of a Mannor is good, and <hi>6.</hi> and <hi>7. E. 6.

Alſo to ſay cleerely that the Plaintiff had entred, &amp;c. is not good, for it ought to be that the Plaintif alſo expelled or amoved the Defendant, as appears in the book of <hi>Entries, Tit. Debt or Leaſe, fo. 11.</hi> or <hi>12. and fo. 175. B.</hi> alſo here the Plea is double to ſay in one cloſe called <hi>Well Cloſe,</hi> and this is matter of ſubſtance, whereof we may take advantage notwithſtanding this general Demurrer. And alſo he ſaith it is parcell of the tenements mentioned in the Declaration, &amp; this may be, and yet never parcell of the thing whereof the Action is brought, for there are other Writs therein comprehended within the pernoſme: And as to the objection of Serjeant <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> that here is a diſcontinuance becauſe the Plea is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by the Iudge of <hi>Niſi prius</hi> into this Court here, if ſeemeth that this needs not, notwithſtanding that it be a collaterall Plea in this Court, in <hi>Trin.</hi> Term at the Aſſiſes, but it is that the parties aforeſaid do attend in <hi>Octab.

Alſo the Iudges of <hi>Niſi prius</hi> have no power to give day in the Court here to the Parties, for the Court here is to appoint the day in the book of the other part, &amp; <hi>37.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97330:47"/>diſcontinuance, for the day given upon the Roll is to hear judgement upon the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and this plea is Collateral, wherefore, &amp;c. and he vouched <hi>10.

H. 6.</hi> the iſſue joyned was, if he who prayes to be received, may plead the entrie of the demandant after the laſt continuance, and the cauſe of the demurrer there, was only if he could plead that plea or not, becauſe it appears not, if he had any thing in reverſion or no, and ſo it ſeemeth, that we might have demurred ſpecially, and this had been no confeſſion, and therefore the general demurrer ſhall not prejudice us, for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of confeſſion. <hi>Bromley</hi> Puiſne Baron, it ſeemeth the plea is not good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a place is not aſſigned in certain in what Town the entrie is, divers Towns being alledged, it ſeemeth that it is no diſcontinuance, for there needs no ſpecial day to be given, but the day of return of the <hi>niſi prius,</hi> for they cannot give any day being delegate only to a ſpecial purpoſe, and it ſeems to me, that the demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer doth not confeſs the plea of the Defendant, but conditionally, <hi>viz.</hi> if the plea fall out to be good, for otherwiſe the Plantiffe ſhall be outed to take advantage of a bad plea, and ſo upon the whole matter, it ſeems that judgement ſhall be given in the <hi>ejectione firme</hi> for the Plantiffe. <hi>Altham</hi> ſecond Baron, to the ſame purpoſe, there needs no ſpecial day to be given by the Iudge of <hi>niſi prius,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that it be upon a Collateral matter, or plea, for by the record in this Court a day is given to the Iurors conditionally, <hi>viz.</hi> if the Iuſtices of <hi>niſi prius</hi> at the Aſſiſes do not come, &amp;c. but to the parties it is given abſolutely: fee <hi>6.

E. 4. fo. 110.</hi> for a plea to the writ, ought to be alwayes certain, and this caſe alſo anſwereth, that which hath been ſaid, that the demurrer confeſſeth the matter againſt the Plantiffe, for I ſay if you plead a releaſe in Bar of a debt, and ſhew no place where the releaſe was made, this demurrer is no confeſſion of the releaſe, except that the cauſe of the demurrer fall out againſt me, wherefore in reſpect that the plea is not good, and is peremptory to the Defendant, as other pleas to the writs are, for this cauſe I conceive Iudgement ſhall be given for the Plantiffe. <hi>Snig</hi> Baron accordingly, that the plea is not good, for the not ſhewing of a place certain wherein the entrie was, as by the matter of diſcontinuance, it ſeemeth that the day of <hi>niſi prius</hi> is all one with the day in Bank, and therefore there needs no day to be given, and for that the death of any of the parties after the verdict, and before the day in Bank ſhall not ſtay the judgement, the Books which were cited on the other parts are different from our caſe, for there the ſuit was adjourned into another Court, and the Courts in the Country are not as the Courts here, and therefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97330:47"/>that in ſuch caſes a day ought to be given: for the manner of pleading we ought to give judgement againſt him who pleads the plea, notwithſtanding the matter admitted by the Plantiffe, wherefore judgement ſhall be given for the Plantiffe. <hi>Tanfield</hi> chief Baron accordingly, the plea whereupon the iſſue was joyned, was for three Mannors and lands in three Towns, and entrie is alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in two Cloſes called &amp;c. parcel of the premiſes, in Bar of the Action, if the Defendant in liew of not guiltie plead an affirmative plea, and at <hi>niſi prius</hi> he pleads another plea, then the entrie ought to be, that the Defendant <hi>relicta veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatione &amp;c.</hi> but in our caſe ſuch an entrie needs not; the plea here ought to be more certain then others, for two reaſons.

                           <item>Secondly, it is in delay of the Plantiffe, and to which no rejoynder can be made, as to the plea it ſeemeth it is not good, for by <hi>10.

                        <hi>RObert Backet</hi> ſeiſed of divers Lands in Fee in the County of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> upon an Indictment in <hi>28. Eliz.</hi> was convicted of Recuſancy for <hi>10.</hi> moneths next before, and died in <hi>1. Jacobi,</hi> and no other conviction ever was, and yet

                        <hi>de facto</hi> he continued a Recuſant untill his death, and his Land, <hi>viz.</hi> two parts thereof were ſeiſed in his life, and the King anſwered of <hi>200.</hi> l. thereof, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in the moneths contained in the Indictment, and now a Writ is iſſued which ſuppoſeth the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> to be indebted to the King in <hi>20.</hi> l. for every moneth be lived after <hi>28.

Vpon which Plea the Kings Atturney Generall demurred, and <hi>Coventry</hi> argued that the Plea is good, &amp; he ſaid that there are three Points to be conſidered;
<list>
                           <item>Firſt, that if a man be convicted of Recuſancy in <hi>28. Eliz.</hi> for <hi>10.</hi> moneths then paſſed, and <hi>de facto</hi> continueth a Recuſant untill his death in <hi>1. Jac.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other conviction, if now the King can claim <hi>20.</hi> l. a moneth for more moueths then are contained in the Indictment whereupon he is convicted.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the King may have the forfeiture for every moneth, whereof no convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was as well as if a conviction had been, then if the King can ſeiſe the Lands for the payment thereof after his death, no ſeiſure being had for it in his life, by the Stat. of the <hi>28. Eliz.</hi> or if the power of ſeiſure be altogether gone by the death of the Recuſant.</item>
                           <item>Thirdly, admitting that the King ſhall have more then is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within the Indictment, if the Debt it ſelf be not gone by the death of the Recuſant;</item>
                        </list> To the firſt Point, there is no Preſident to be found that any man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed before <hi>28. Eliz.</hi> was charged to the Payment of more then that which was within the Indictment, and the words of the Statute of <hi>28. Eliz.</hi> contained within this Clauſe which provides for the payment due ſince the Conviction, do not inforce any conſtruction to the contrary, and in this Clauſe the words being, (do yet remain unpaid) are not proper words but for a thing payable before this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, for ſo many moneths whereof he was convicted of Recuſancy, and the words without any other conviction are to be underſtood for ſo much as was unpaid of that contained in the Indictment, and the laſt Clauſe of this Branch of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute hath not the words without any conviction, and the other Clauſe provides that by expreſſe words for the future time, every perſon who ſhall be once convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall forfeit, &amp;c without other conviction, and it was reſolved <hi>Hill. 4. Jacobi</hi> in the Kings Bench between <hi>Grinſtone</hi> and <hi>Oliver,</hi> that the Statute of <hi>28. Eliz.</hi> alters, and adds three things to the Statute of <hi>23. Eliz.</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. That all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney due for Recuſancy ſhall be paid into the Exchequer.</item>
                           <item>2. This limits a time for payment thereof yearly, <hi>viz.</hi> in the four Terms of the year.</item>
                           <item>3. This giveth a penalty, <hi>viz.</hi> power to ſeiſe all the goods, and two parts for non-payment, but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97330:49"/>all that is only for that which was payable before the conviction, and therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>e the words in the Branch which contains our Caſe, have apt words of conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he ſhall pay all due for the paine of ſeiſure, for <hi>23. Eliz.</hi> gives no ſeiſure, but impriſonment if payment be not made within three moneths after judgement, and ſo in our caſe Conviction ought to precede the duty: To the ſecond Point it ſeemeth that the power of ſeiſure within this Statute is gone by the death of the Recuſant, for before the Statute of <hi>1. Jacobi</hi> the power for ſeiſure was but a penalty, that if the party fail in payment of <hi>20.</hi> l. a moneth then &amp;c. and in all caſes upon penall Laws, if the party die before the penalty inflicted, this ſhall not be inflicted at all, and that this is but a penalty, he vouched one <hi>Grayes</hi> caſe in <hi>1.</hi> and <hi>2. Jacobi</hi> to be adjudged accordingly: Alſo the words in this Statute which give the ſeiſure of Land, appointeth a levying to be of the <hi>3.</hi> part for the maintenance of the Offendor, his Wife, Children, and Family, and after his death he hath no Wife, ſo that if it be demanded when the ſeiſin muſt be, the anſwer is, then when a third part may be left for his uſe, which cannot be but in the life of the Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: Alſo it appoints that the ſeiſure ought to be by Proceſſe which ought to be in the life of the party by intendment: Alſo the <hi>Proviſo</hi> of the Statute of <hi>28. Eli.</hi> ſaith, that if any perſon ſhall dye, no ſeiſure ſhall inſue, or be continued, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>d out caſe is within thoſe words, for in regard there hath been no ſeiſure in his life, therefore after his death no ſeiſure ought to inſue, and the words which purport another ſemblance of conſtruction, <hi>viz.</hi> and ſatisfaction of all arrerages, are to be underſtood only in caſe where there was a former ſeiſure, that is in the life of the party, and have reference to the words (to be continued) and that the intent is ſo, he ſaid that the words are, ſo that the Heir ſhall pay no more but ſo much as the Land was ſeiſed for.</item>
                        </list> To the third, it ſeemeth that in this caſe the debt it ſelf is gone by the death of the party; At the Common Law, a penalty ſhall never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered againſt the Heir, except that judgement be given againſt the Anceſtor, and for that ſee <hi>40. E. 3. Executors 74. and 41. Aſſ. pl. 15. and 15. Eliz Dyer 322.</hi> And alſo if a Recuſant had been convicted upon the Sat. of <hi>23. Eliz.</hi> and dyed before judgement, cleerely this forfeiture ſhall never be charged upon the Heir, for the words are, that a Recuſant ſhall forfeit <hi>20.</hi> l. a moneth, and if he doe not pay it, then appoints the recovery by Bill, Plaint, or Information, and this ought to be alwaies in the life of the party, then the Stat. of <hi>28. Eliz.</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not a new debt or Forfeiture, but gives a penalty for the non-payment of that which was a debt within <hi>23. Eliz.</hi> and that the intent of the Stat. of <hi>28. Eli.</hi> was but ſuch, this is proved by the Title of the Act. <hi>viz.</hi> for the more ſpeedy and due execution, &amp;c. <hi>2.</hi> It is proved by the firſt words of the Act, for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all delaies, &amp;c. ſo that it appears, that this Act is but as a penalty meerly: Alſo he ſaid, that this Stat. of <hi>28. Eliz.</hi> diſpenceth with the conviction as to the penalty, but doth not take away the Conviction: alſo he ſaid that conviction without Iudgement maketh not a Debt: Alſo he who is convicted by proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and dieth, is diſcharged: Alſo he ſaid that our Caſe hath been compared to a Debt upon an Obligation, but this is not like, for the Stat. ſtands not inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, but hath reference to <hi>23.</hi> for otherwiſe a Recuſant may be doubly charged, that is, upon both the Statutes, for there is no means to recover the Debt but by this Statute of <hi>23.

H. 7.</hi> and <hi>2. E. 4.</hi> wherefore the Court ſaid, that judgement ought to be given againſt the Plantiffs, but yet at the deſire of the ſome, the Court gave day to the Councel on both parts to argue the caſe; at which day came <hi>Heneag Finch</hi> for the Plantiffs, and he argued to the matter in Law, and therein he ſaid, that by the feofment of Tenant in tail, the uſe to himſelf for life, the remainder to his daughters for years, without limiting the reſidue of the uſe, that in this caſe the reſidue of the uſe ſhall be in the feoffes, and not in the feoffor, for by him there is a difference between a feofment by him who had a fee with limitation of an uſe as above, and a feofment made by him who derives an eſtate out of a fee, for when Tenant for life, or Tenant in tail makes a feofment, and limits an uſe for part of the eſtate as above, there the reſidue of the iſſue ſhall be to the feoffee, and he vouched <hi>Caſtle</hi> and <hi>Dods</hi> caſe adjudged in the Common Pleas, <hi>8.

Secondly, admit that the reſidue of the uſe in this caſe ſhall he to the feoffor, yet he ſhall not be remitted to the uſe as it ſeemeth, the words of the Statute of <hi>27.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97330:50"/>confeſs a fee determinable, he needs not Traverſe the fee alledged by the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe; but in our caſe here is an allegation made by the words of a fee, to be in the feoffor, and the Bar confeſſeth only, as of a fee gained in an inſtant; but I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that if the Bar had been, that the Feoffor was Tenant for years, and made a Feofment; this had been good without Traverſe, but when Tenant in tail makes a Feofment, it ſhall not be intended, that he gained a Fee, becauſe it may be he hath purchaſed the remainder, and thereby had lawfully acquitted it, as an addition to his eſtate: and here the ſaying in the Deelaration, that <hi>Edward Stanley</hi> was ſeiſed in Fee as a thing material, and of neceſſitie, and not ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as the pleading in a Declaration for debt upon an Obligation to ſay, that the Obligor was of full age, or as a Repetition of the writ which needs not be Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, and that it appears in <hi>15.

                     <p>UPon a motion made by Serjeant <hi>Barker</hi> it appeared, that one <hi>Henry Clare</hi> was indebted to the King, and was ſeiſed of a third part of certain lands in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> of <hi>Lincolns Inne</hi> was ſeiſed of other two Acres of the ſame laud as Tenant in Common, and the beaſts of Mr. <hi>Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> paſtured promiſcuouſly upon all the land, and <hi>Henry Clare</hi> put more Cattle in, and upon proces to levy this debt for the King, the Sheriffe took the Cattle of Mr. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> and ſold them, and it was now ruled, that in regard, it was lawful for a Tenant in Common to put in his Cattle upon all the land, and that if they depaſture all the graſs the other hath no remedy, and for that cauſe the Sheriffe could not take thoſe Cattle for the debt of another Tenant in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,

                     <p>VPon evidence to a Iury, it was ſaid by <hi>Tanfield,</hi> that if a man make Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Feofment of lands in two Towns, and a Letter of Attorney to make livery, and before livery made by the Attorney, the Feoffor himſelf maketh livery of the land in one Town, this is a Countermand of the Letter of Atturney, and ſo livery cannot be made by the Attorney in the other Town; and <hi>quere</hi> if the Towns were in ſeveral Counties. <hi>Bacon</hi> the Kings Solicitor ſaid, that if a man make a Charter of Feofment of two ſeveral Acres, whereof one is in leaſe for years, and the other in demeaſne, and the Feoffor makes a Letter of Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to make livery, and before that be executed, the Feoffor himſelf makes live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, now although that one Acre cannot paſs by this livery, becauſe it is in leaſe, yet this is a Countermand, and revocation of the authoritie given by the Letter of Attorney, for his intent is manifeſt ſo to be, to which <hi>Tanfield,</hi> and all the Court agreed. <hi>Hobert</hi> Attorney general ſaid, that in this caſe, although that one of the Acres was in leaſe, yet in regard it appeareth not, that the Leſſee was in actual poſſeſſion, therefore he conceived, that it ſhould be conſtrued, that the Leſſee was not in actual poſſeſſion at the time of the livery made by the Leſſor in the name of all, and in reſpect there was no houſe upon the Acre in Leaſe, it may be intended, that the Leſſee ſhould be in actual poſſeſſion, but for that cauſe he rather conceived, that it ſhould be conſtrued, that the Leſſee was not in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo the livery might well operate to paſs it. <hi>Tanfield,</hi> and all the Court denied, that the livery was good to paſs it, although that the Leſſor was in actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al poſſeſſion; but where Mr. <hi>Atturney</hi> alledged further, that before the livery made an Infant had a Term for years in this Acre in leaſe, and that the Feoffor at the time of the livery, was gardian to the Infant, and thereby had a poſſeſſion therein, and therefore the livery made in the other Acre in the name of all, ſhould be good to paſs all, to which the Court agreed, and thereupon directed the Iury to finde the livery, and ſeiſin to be made of all: and in this caſe the Court inclined, that becauſe this Feofment was made, but ten dayes before, that the Feoffor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Treaſon, and in aſmuch as it was made to the uſe of the ſon being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and not upon conſideration of marriage, that therefore the Feofment ſhould be fraudulent, and void as to the King, but the Atturney general ſaid, that this Feofment was made in performance of a precedent agreement, <hi>viz.</hi> it was agreed that the Feoffor ſhould make ſuch a conveyance to an uſe &amp;c. and that the wife of the Feoffor alſo being an Inheritrix, ſhould make ſuch a conveyance of her land which was done accordingly, and upon proofe of this agreement, the Court in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined that it was no fraud, and in this caſe it was ruled by the Court, if parties have matter of evidence by the Records of this Court, they ought to produce the Records themſelves, for Copies of them are not allowable.</p>

That a preſentment in the Court may be after the death of the ſurrenderer, and the admittance thereupon is good, and he compared it to the Caſe of the delivery of a Deed, as an Eſcroll which may be delivered as his Deed after the death of the Maker, as it is in <hi>Jennings</hi> and <hi>Braggs caſe Cook lib. 3.</hi> which was not denyed by the Court.

But when it goes further, and doth not leave the condition to be carried by the Law, in ſuch caſe all the words ſhould be void, becauſe it cannot be according to the intent, as in the caſe of a reſervation of rent, the Law will carry it to the Reverſion, but if it be particularly reſerved, then it will go according to the reſervation, or otherwiſe will be void, and ſo here <hi>Tanfield:</hi> Admit that here was a conditionall eſtate by vertue of the Surrender laſt made, and this condition is alſo to be performed to a ſtranger, which general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought to be taken ſtrictly, yet, as it is here, he who will take advantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ought to prove a voluntary neglect in the party, in the not performance of the Condition, and inaſmuch as there is no certain time appointed, when the payment of this Annuall rent ſhould be made, but generally at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> next after the death of the ſaid <hi>Anne,</hi> thereby in this caſe the Chuch-wardens ought to notifie the death of the ſaid <hi>Anne,</hi> before the firſt day of payment, by reaſonable ſpace, or otherwiſe the condition is not broken, and alſo it is appointed here to be paid in the preſence of four diſcreet Pariſhioners, by the party who ſhould perform the condition, yet by intendment he hath no notice, who are diſcreet, or who are

The 2d. Matter is, admitting that this is void, &amp; that the Queen preſented <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell</hi> who died before Inſtitution or admiſſion, if this preſentation be good to <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,</hi> without a Repeal of the Preſentation made by the Queen, and it ſeems to be in both points for the Plaintiff. To the firſt point be ſaid, That the intent of the Statute was to cradicate all manner of Symonies, and therefore the words are not, if any man give money to be preſented, but they are if any preſent for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97330:53"/>money, and the Iutors here found <hi>20.</hi> l. to be given, and nothing for what it was given, or to whom it was given, for if money be the meede, a Preſentation is void, and therefore if <hi>I. S.</hi> be Patron of the Church of <hi>D.</hi> which is void, and a ſtranger ſaith to me, procure the Preſentation for <hi>A.</hi> and you ſhall have <hi>100.</hi> l. and he procured <hi>A.</hi> to be preſented: here if the Patron had notice of the money given to me, this Preſentation is void, but otherwiſe not, and in our caſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out notice of the Parſon the Admiſſor, and all which enſued thereupon is void, by reaſon of the Symonie in the Patron, and it is void as to the Parſon alſo, and if in this Caſe we are not within the words of the Statute, yet we are within the intent cleerely, as upon <hi>1. Ed. 6.</hi> of <hi>Chanteries,</hi> an eſtate made for years, or for life to Superſtitious uſes ſhall be within the intent, although not within the words of that Statute, as it appears in <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Lamberts caſe Cooke lib. 4.</hi> So the Statute of <hi>11. H. 7.</hi> ſhould be conſtrued to meet with Caſes of like miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, as it appears in Sir <hi>George Browns caſe, Cooke Lib. 3.</hi> and <hi>Panor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitane</hi> ſaith that <hi>Simonia eſt Studioſa voluntas emendi, vel vendendi aliquid Spirituale, vel Spirituali annexum cum opere ſubſequente.</hi> To the ſecond Point, it ſeems that the Preſentation made by the King to <hi>Calvert</hi> is good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aid of the Statute of <hi>6. H. 8. cap. 15.</hi> for <hi>Covell</hi> who were the Preſentee of the Queeen had nor intereſt, no eſtate, and yet if he had, it would be void by the death of the Queen, for the preſentation is but a commendation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Patron preſent his Villaine, this maketh no infranchiſement, and ſo if Leſſee for years of a Patronage be preſented, this doth not extinguiſh his Term. And whereas it hath been ſaid, that the Kings Grant cannot be conſtrued to two intents, true it is if it be to the Kings prejudice, but otherwiſe it is, if it be for his benefit, as plainly appears in <hi>Englefieldss caſe Cook lib. 7. See 17. Ed. 3. fo. 29.</hi> Alſo it is without queſtion, that the King may actually revoke his Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as it appears by <hi>28.

Jac.</hi> in the Common Pleas, <hi>Rot 1722.</hi> one <hi>Williams caſe,</hi> that an Actuall Revocation or Repeale is not neceſſary; And ſo it was adjudged, <hi>Trin. 8. Jac. Rot. 1811.</hi> in the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſters caſe,</hi> and therefore the King may make a Preſentation to a Church which belongs to him by reaſon of Wardſhip under the Seale of the Court of Wards, becauſe the preſentation is only a Commendation as it was there ſaid, and ſo it was agreed alſo, <hi>Trin. 8. Jac.</hi> at Serjeants June by <hi>Flemming, Cook, and Tanfield</hi> in the <hi>Lord Windſors caſe,</hi> referred unto them out of the Court of Wards, and there it was ſaid by <hi>Cook,</hi> that the King may preſent by Parol, as it appears by <hi>17. Eliz. Dyer,</hi> and that a Second Adminiſtration may be well granted without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of the firſt, and alſo it ſeemes, that the Statute of <hi>6. H. 8. cap. 15.</hi> doth not extend to a Chaplain, for he is not a Servant within that Statute, nor a Preſentation is not a thing within that Statute, and moreover in this Caſe, <hi>Covel</hi> who was the Queens Preſentee is not in life, and therefore this Caſe cleerely is out of the Clauſe of the Statute of <hi>6 H. 8.</hi> and ſo he concluded on the whole matter, that Iudgement ought to be given for the Plaintiff. <hi>Altham</hi> the ſecond Baron accordingly; The Preſentation made to <hi>Kitchin</hi> is void, and the Admiſſion, and all ſubſequent thereupon is void alſo, for the words of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute are, that if a Preſentation be made for monie, it ſhall be void, and that the King may preſent that Turne, and therefore the want of privity in the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent is nothing to the purpoſe, as to the avoiding of the Benefice, but his want of privitie availeth to excuſe him of being <hi>Simoniacus:</hi> yet becauſe he is <hi>Simoniace Promotus</hi> the preſentation is void, and the King ſhall have it by the expreſſe words of the Statute, and therefore as it ſeems if in this Statute there had been an expreſſe ſaving of the intereſt of the Incumbent, by reaſon of his innocency, yet ſuch a ſaving of Intereſt had been void, and repugnant, in reſpect that it was expreſly given to the King before, as it is in <hi>Nichols caſe in Plowden</hi> upon the Stat. of <hi>1.

To the ſecond matter, it ſeems that by the Queens death, her Preſentation is determined cleerely, and ſo in caſe of a common perſon, for if an Admiſſion, &amp;c. ſhould follow after the death of the Preſentor, this is without any Authority of the inſtrument of Preſentation, for although there were no Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, there is no Preſentation, and he ſaid that the Preſentation paſſeth no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, but is as a Commendation, and therefore he compared it to the Caſe of <hi>Say</hi> and <hi>Fuller</hi> in <hi>Plowden Com.</hi> If a Leaſe be made for ſo many years as a ſtranger ſhall name, there ought to be certainty of years appointed in the life of the parties, or otherwiſe it will be void, and in <hi>38.

Quare impedit 11.</hi> That a Preſentment made by the Biſhop becometh <hi>null,</hi> and void by his death, and therefore it appeareth in <hi>Fitzh.</hi> Office of Court <hi>29.</hi> that licence to alien granted to the King is void by the Kings death, &amp; there needeth no actual Repeal or recital of the new preſentation, &amp; yet I agree that the King may make an actual repeal if he will, as it appears by divers caſes which have been cited before, but that is of neceſſity to be done, and as it ſeems the words of the Statute <hi>6. H. 8.</hi> prove that before this Statute a ſecond Grant made, the firſt void with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out actual repeal, in caſe where the thing paſſed by the Grant, and by <hi>38. E. 3. fo. 3.4.</hi> it appears that a ſecond Preſentation made by the King, was good without a repeal of the firſt, and by <hi>Gaſcoigne 7. H. 4.32.</hi> if the King make a Preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one, and then preſents another, without recitall or repeal of the firſt, yet the Biſhop ought to receive the latter Preſentee, for it is good without actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, wherefore judgement ought to be given for the Plaintiff. <hi>Snig Baron</hi> ſaid, that as the Action is brought, judgement ought to be given for the Plaintiff, but if the Plaintiff had brought a <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> peradventure I ſhould have been of another opinion; And as to the point of Symonie by the Civill Law, it was puniſhable by deprivation, and the guilt of the Patron ſhould prejudice the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as to matter of Commodity in the Parſonage, and at the Common Law, if the Parſon will pleade ſuch Preſentment, he ſhould be prejudiced, as appears by our Books, and hereby the incumbency the words of the Statute will not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, for then the Queen ſhould not Preſent, if an uſurper preſent, and the Preſentee is in by ſix moneths, this gives Title of Preſentation to the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rightfull Patron, alſo it ſeemeth, That if <hi>I. S.</hi> hath an Advowſon, and <hi>A.</hi> purchaſe the next avoidance to the intent to preſent <hi>B.</hi> and the Church becomes void, and <hi>A.</hi> preſents <hi>B.</hi> this is Symonie by averment, as by good pleading the Preſentation of <hi>B.</hi> ſhall be adjudged void. To the ſecond Point, in reſpect that the Plaintiff had the poſſeſſion by induction, it is no queſtion but he may retaine a poſſeſſorie Action for the Titles, But if it were in a <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> it would be materiall whether a Repeal ſhould be in the caſe or not, according to the Preſidents in the Booke of Entries, <hi>fo. 303, 304, 305.</hi> for if a Licence be Granted to purchaſe in Mortmaine, this may well be executed after the death of the Queene, as it appeareth by <hi>Fitzherberts natura brevium</hi> expreſly, and ſo in <hi>Dyer,</hi> a licenſe of Tranſportation doth not ceaſe by the Kings death <hi>7. H. 4.</hi> in the Counteſs of <hi>Kents</hi> caſe, it appears, when the King makes a grant which is void, yet there ſhall be no new grant without an
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97330:54"/>actual repeal, but it ſeems we are out of the intent of the Statute of <hi>6. H. 8.</hi> becauſe the words during his pleaſure are not in the grant or Patent, and ſo upon the whole matter judgement ſhall be given for the Plantiffe. <hi>Tanfield</hi> according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the caſe is, that the Defendant had prioritie of the poſſeſſion of the Corn for which the action is brought, and yet it ſeems judgement ought to be given for the Plantiffe: and firſt, as this caſe is, here is Simonie by the Civil Law, and the partie had his benefice by Simonie, although he be not conuſant thereof. Secondly, admit that here was not Simonie by the intendment of the Civil Law, yet the Statute hath made an avoidance of the benifice in this caſe, although it be not Simonie, for the Statute ſpeaks not one word of Simonie throughout the Act, and yet by expreſs words it doth avoid ſuch preſentations as this is, and as to the Civil Law, ſuch benefice is to be made void by ſentence declaratorie, but it is not void <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> as it ſeems in the caſe where a common perſon was conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Simonie, but the text of the Civil Law ſayes expreſly, that the Church ought not to be filled <hi>Corruptivè,</hi> or by corruption, and the Civil Law expreſſeth ſuch a perſon as is in our caſe, by <hi>Simoniace promotus,</hi> and calls him who is <hi>particeps criminis Simoniacus,</hi> and he who is <hi>Simoniacus,</hi> is by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law deprived not only of the benefice <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> but alſo is deprived to be a Miniſter, and adjudged guiltie in <hi>Culpa et poena. Petrus Benefieldus</hi> a late writer &amp; of good authoritie ſaith, that if a friend give money to a patron, to make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to him &amp;c. and the incumbent payes it, ſuch an incumbent is <hi>Simoniacus</hi> by the Civil Law, and ſo if the incumbent pay the mony not knowing it untill after the induction, yet he is <hi>Simoniacus,</hi> and by him if a friend gives money, and the Parſon is thereupon preſented, though the Parſon if he knew not of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney given, yet he ſhall be deprived of the benefice, and this difference was certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Anderſon,</hi> and <hi>Gawdey,</hi> to the Councel table upon a reference made to them by the King, touching the filling of benefices by corrupt means, and the Statute of purpoſe forbears to uſe the word Simonie, for avoiding of nice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of that word in the Civil Law, and therefore the makers of the Act ſets down plainly the words of the Statute, that if any ſhall be promoted for money &amp;c. ſo that by theſe words it is not material from whom the money comes, and then in ſuch caſes for the avoiding of all ſuch grand offences, a liberal conſtruction ought to be made, as hath been uſed in ſuch caſes, and therefore he remembred the large conſtruction which was made upon the Statute of fines, in the Lord <hi>Zou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> caſe <hi>lib. Cook 3.</hi> and ſo upon the Statute of uſurie, it hath been adjudged, that if money be lent to be re-paid with uſe above <hi>10.</hi> l. in the hundred at ſuch a day, if three men or one man ſo long live, in theſe caſes all ſuch bargains and contracts are void within the intent of the Statute, as it hath been adjudged in the Common Pleas, and ſo it is in <hi>Gooches</hi> caſe <hi>Cook lib. 5.</hi> upon the Statute of fraudulent conveyances, and ſecret Ioyntures; alſo upon the Statute of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie it was adjudged, although ſome of the Common Pleas doubted of it, in regard a father is bound to provide for his ſon; and <hi>Rogers</hi> and <hi>Bakers</hi> caſe in this Court was an antient caſe, and adjudged for the Plantiffe: and as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther point, it is found by the verdict, that the preſentation made by the Queen to <hi>Covel</hi> is not revoked, nor admitted, which words implie that <hi>Covel</hi> is ſtill li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in caſe of a ſpecial verdict, and therefore to argue to that point, as if it were found that <hi>Covel</hi> was living, yet he conceived, that the preſentation without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and Induction is determined by the Queens death, and therefore in <hi>2. Ed. 3.</hi> a licenſe of Alienation clearly is not good in the time of another King, for the licenſe ſaith which are holden of us &amp;c. and by the death of the King they are not holden of him. <hi>Fitzherberts natura brevium contra 16 H. 8.</hi> the nature of a preſentment is explained, where an Infant would avoid his preſentation, and in the principal caſe the Biſhop cannot make any admiſſion upon this preſentation of <hi>Covel</hi> after the Queens death, for he cannot do that in any manner according to the preſentation, becauſe that is determined by the Queens death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97330:55"/>it ſeems clearly there needs no repeal in ſuch a caſe, although it appears by ſome preſidents, that repeals have been uſed in ſuch caſes, and as to the caſe <hi>17. Eliz. Dyer 339.</hi> that proveth not that there ought to be any repeal, for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears there, that judgement was given upon a reaſon altogether different from our caſe, and that was, becauſe a preſentation was obtained of the Queen, a <hi>quare impedit</hi> depending by her, of which ſuit ſhe had no notice, and for that cauſe her ſecond preſentation was void, and that was the true reaſon of that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it is alſo put in <hi>Greens</hi> caſe <hi>Cook lib. 6.</hi> and I was preſent <hi>Mich. 17. Eliz.</hi> when this caſe was adjudged, and the ſole reaſon which they gave for the judgement was, becauſe the preſentation by intendment could not take away the Action attached by the Queen, for then the Queens grant ſhould enure to a double intent, which the Law will never tollerate without expreſs words purporting ſo much, but in our caſe there is no ſuch double intendment, and therefore &amp;c. but if there had been an admiſſion, and inſtitution purſuing the preſentation of <hi>Covel,</hi> although no induction, yet peradventure in ſuch caſe, there ought to have been an appeal, becauſe in ſuch caſe it is not only the Queens Act, but of the ordinary alſo, interpoſing, which is a Iudicial Act, alſo without queſtion, we are out of the Statute of <hi>6. H. 8.</hi> for here is no grant made by the Queen, and a preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion clearly is not within that Statute, and for that other reaſon the preſentation of <hi>Calvert</hi> is good, without recital of the Queens preſentation: alſo clearly if there ought to be a repeal in the caſe, yet it is not examinable in this Action of Treſpaſs which is poſſeſſorie, and for the profits only, but it may be examinable in a <hi>quare impedit,</hi> and as to <hi>Greens</hi> caſe <hi>Cook lib. 6.</hi> which hath been uſed as an authoritie in this caſe, that differs much from our caſe, for there the thing which made the Queens preſentation void, was contained within the very Charter of the preſentation, and therefore differed from our caſe, wherefore he commanded judgement ſhould be entred for the Plantiffe, and ſo it was.</p>

                        </list> and I alwayes obſerved, that which the common law calleth fraud, ought to be of ſuch nature as ſhall be tortious, and prejudicial to a third perſon, and put him in a worſe eſtate and condition then he was before, and then he who is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced in ſome caſes ſhould avoid ſuch conveyances by the common Law: <hi>22. Aſſiſes 72.43. Ed. 3.2.</hi> and <hi>32.</hi> — the Defendant in debt after judgement aliens his goods, and he himſelf takes the profits, yet the Plantiffe ſhall have them in execution; ſo that if a man binde himſelf, and his heirs in an Obligation, and dies, and aſſets deſcend to his heir, who by Covin aliens thoſe aſſets, yet he ſhall be charged in debt; for in theſe caſes the Plantiffe had a lawful debt, and ſuch lands and goods before the alienation were liable, and that former intereſt was intended to be defeated by thoſe alienations, and therefore they are void: but of the other ſide, where no former intereſt of the partie is wronged, there no fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent conveyance was void at the Common Law; and therefore if Tenant in Knights ſervice had made a fraudulent Feofment to defraud the Lord of his ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, this was not aided by the Common Law until the Statute of <hi>Marlebridge,</hi> for the title of the Lord was not prejudiced or wronged by this Feofment, becauſe it was ſubſequent to the Feofment, alſo after the ſaid Statute the Lord was without remedy for his releaſe, for it is agreed in <hi>17.

As to the third it ſeems that, that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute doth not make lands in uſe liable to debts, the words of the Statute are, that the King ſhall ſeiſe two parts of the lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, leaſes of Farms of ſuch offendors, ſo that they are as general as the words of the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter 2. cap. 18.</hi> and here thoſe lands and leaſes were not the Recuſants, for he had but a confidence in them: the firſt clauſe of the Statute doth not extend thereunto for two cauſes.

                        </list> Therefore it was adjudged in Sir <hi>William Greenes caſe:</hi> that this ſeiſure ſhall not go in ſatisfaction of ſuch debt, but the King ſhall hold it as a penalty for the contempt untill the debt be paid, ſo that when a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute impoſeth a penaltie for a contempt, as the contempt is perſonall, ſo is the penalty; And therefore the death of the party before that it be excuted or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>rem judicatam,</hi> diſchargeth all: and I ſhall prove it by the different plea in an Action upon a penall Statute, and other common Actions, and therefore in debt, not guilty is no plea, but in debt upon a penall Law it is a good Plea, for in truth untill it be adjudged, it is no debt, but a contempt, <hi>Michaelmas 41, 42. Eliz.</hi> betwixt <hi>Car</hi> and <hi>Jones,</hi> and in debt upon the Statute of <hi>2. Ed. 6.</hi> not guilty was adjudged a good plea, <hi>Trin. 42.

Aſſ.</hi> which implies that it is not perfect untill the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and before it is only a contempt, and if ſo, then by the death of the party it is diſcharged. Thirdly, I ſhall prove it by Authority, that the death of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before Iudgement diſchargeth aſwell the contempt, as the penaltie of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Law, <hi>40. Ed, 3. Executor 74.</hi> debt lies not againſt the Executors of a Iay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, who ſuffers Priſoners to eſcape, <hi>15. Eliz. Dyer 322.</hi> in the like Caſe the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Court was, that an Action did not lye againſt the Executors of the Warden of the <hi>Fleet.</hi> but there ought to have been a Iudgement againſt him in his life time, for the Offence is but a Treſpaſs by negligence which dies with the Perſon, <hi>18. Eliz. Dyer.</hi> An Action brought againſt the Heire, and ruled that it doth not lie, for it is a <hi>Maxime</hi> that no Law or Statute chargeth the Heir for the wrong or treſpaſſe of his Father: Alſo it is to be obſerved in the Principall Caſe, that the Statute limits the ſeiſure to be by Proces out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> ſo no ſeiſure can be without Proces, as it may be upon ſome other Statute; But a judiciall courſe is hereby preſcribed whereupon the Partie may plead with the King for his Land, and therefore if that courſe be not purſued in the life of the party, it is too late to purſue it after his death: Alſo the words are, that he ſhall ſeiſe all the goods, and two parts of the Lands of ſuch Offendors. But after his death the goods are not his, but his Executors; and the Lands are not his, but his Heirs, and a ſeiſure by way of penalty relateth no higher then to the time of the ſeiſure: alſo the words of the ſubſequent <hi>Proviſo</hi> explame it further, for it it be demanded when the King ſhall ſeiſe two parts, it is anſwered at the ſame time when he leaveth the third part, and when muſt be leave the third part, it is auſwered, in the life of the Recuſant, That it may be for the maintenance of his Wife, Children, and Family, and after his death he hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wife, Children, nor Family, for in a Writ of Dower, the Demandant ſhall ſay that ſhe was Wife, and not that ſhe is Wife: As to the laſt matter it ſeems that the Statute of <hi>1. Jac. cap. 4</hi> hath diſcharged this Land, admitting that it was not diſcharged before, wherein the words are, and if any Recuſant ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after die, his Heir being no Recuſant: That in every ſuch Caſe, every ſuch Heire
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97330:57"/>ſhall be freed and diſcharged of all and ſingular the penalties, charges, and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances happening upon him, or her in reſpect, or by reaſon of his or her Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors recuſancy; and as to <hi>Walter de Chirtons Caſe,</hi> who being an Accompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to the Ring, purchaſed Lands of <hi>A.</hi> with the Kings money by Covin, and took the profits, nevertheleſſe upon Inquiſition it was adjudged, that they ſhould be ſeiſed into the Kings hands for his debt: I agree that to be good Law, becauſe <hi>A.</hi> when he received the ſaid money of <hi>Walter de Chirton,</hi> that being the Kings monie, <hi>A.</hi> immediately thereby became a Debtor, and an Accemptent to the King, and then into whoſe hands ſoever theſe Lands do after come, they are ſtill chargable for that money, and therefore, &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97330:57"/>there it is expreſſed in the Patent, that the party had informed the Queen of a thing which is falſe, and this is not expreſſed in our caſe, yet it ſeems to me that there is no diverſitie between that caſe, and the caſe in queſtion, for it is plaine that in our caſe, that the ſurrender and conſideration, are the information of the party which was the motive to induce the Queen to her grant, for the ſuggeſtion is grounded upon the ſurrender, the which ſurrender is fraudulent and deceptive, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Patent is void. <hi>Altonwoods caſe Cooke Lib. 1.40.</hi> The King grants the Mannor of <hi>Riton</hi> and <hi>Condor,</hi> where in truth they were two Manners, there neither of them paſſe, <hi>Fitzh.

And it may be conſtrued as a <hi>Proviſo</hi> in an Indenture, within ſome Caſes, doth amount to a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and condition alſo, as it was in the caſe of <hi>Simpſon and Titterell,</hi> and alſo in the caſe of the Earl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> vouched in <hi>Cook lib. 2.</hi> in the Lord <hi>Cromwels</hi> caſe, and therefore I conceive that the words <hi>ſuper ſe Aſſumpſit aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficare</hi> is parcell of the conſideration, aſwell as if it had been <hi>pro eo quod aedifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit;</hi> and ſo avoids the Patent by the not performance thereof: <hi>Altham Second Baron,</hi> ſaies, it ſeems to me that the Iudgement ought to be given for the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there are three things conſiderable in the Caſe: Firſt, whether the Leaſe made to <hi>Hitchmore</hi> were ever good or not, in reſpect of a falſe ſuggeſtion; Secondly, whether in that the conſideration, that he did aſſume upon himſelf to repair, and the Queen indeed never had any precedent information made of the want thereof, do avoid the Patent in the foundation; Thirdly, admit it be good in the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether the Leaſe become void afterwards for not repaſting; And firſt I will ſpeak to ſuch things which in my opinion will not avoid the Patent; Firſt it ſeems, that this want of not aſſuring, doth not vitiate the Patent, for the word <hi>Aſſumpſit ſuppoſeth</hi> matter of Fact executed, and whether it be true or falſe, it cannot be now examined, no more then in the Caſes put <hi>21.

H. 6.27.</hi> The King in his Privie Seale ſuggeſts a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Fact, this doth not deſtroy the Patent, alſo although that the conſideration is aſwell for that he aſſumed to repair, as, &amp;c. and it is found that he hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, yet this fault ſhall not avoid the Patent, for as it ſeems here it is not in nature of a conditionall eſtate, or Grant, as if it had been in conſideration he ſhall repaire, for as the words are here placed, it is intended that the Queen will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon the <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> and not upon the condition, and grant, and it ſeems that the Patent is void, only upon the miſrecitall, and the falſe ſuggeſtion, which is the firſt Point, for it appears by the miſrecitall, that the Queen was deceived in a thing materiall, and valuable, and therefore the Patent void, and yet I agree, that every falſe ricitall or ſuggeſtion doth not avoid a Patent, as in <hi>9. Ed. 4. Baggots Aſſ. 29. Ed. 3.7.</hi> if the King recite in his Patent, that he had made a precedent Grant upon a Petition, yet this falſity doth not avoid the Patent, and in <hi>27.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97330:58"/>this is all one as if it ſhould appear in the Recitall or conſideration, that the Kings intention was grounded upon a matter of value, and the King therein deceived: therefore in <hi>Altonwoods caſe Cooke lib. 1.</hi> If the King recite that <hi>A.</hi> is indebted unto him, as Executor of <hi>B</hi> and he releaſe to him all demands generally, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be releaſed, but that which he owed as Executor, and ſo if the King recite, that whereas an Advowſon is holden of <hi>I.

Secondly the Queens intent was to make an intire Leaſe of all in poſſeſſion, and this cannot be, for part of the thing it enures but as a Leaſe in reverſion, or future intereſt, and therefore void, as it is in <hi>Altonwoods caſe Cook Lib. 1.</hi> and the Queen hath a double prejudice hereby.

                           <item>Secondly, ſhe cannot enter therein for the condition broken, wherefore, &amp;c. <hi>Tanfield</hi> accordingly, that judgement ſhould be given for the Plaintiff: The Patent recites, That all the Term-which <hi>Potter</hi> had ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, &amp;c. where in truth it was not ſo, and therefore it is cleere that the Queen is deceived therein, and the Grant void, for it was the very inducement which procured the new Patent, and this recital is grounded upon the words of the deed of ſurrender, ſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the ſurren. is grounded upon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> information of <hi>Hitchmore</hi> contained the ſurrender.</item>

S.</hi> ſhould ſo long live, he ought to aver his life in the Declaration, becauſe it determines, by limitation at his death, but otherwiſe it is upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if a Parſon make a leaſe for years, the Leſſee muſt aver the life of the Parſon, becauſe by his death the leaſe ends by a limitation implied, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ſhould if it were upon condition, for the performance of that needs not be averred; but that ought to be ſhewed on the other part, and ſo it ſeemeth, that as wel for the point of falſitie in the recital, as alſo in the not performing of the conſideration, that the leaſe is void, and the Plantiffe ſhould have judgement which was entred accordingly. <hi>Snig,</hi> Baron, was of opmion againſt all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Barons, and he held that judgement ought to be given for the Defendant, for he laid, that the Patent made to <hi>Hitchmore</hi> proveth that it was not made by reaſon of any ſuggeſtion of the partie, for it is expreſſed to be made <hi>ex mero mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu, &amp;c.</hi> and then the not ſurrendring of the other Term doth not vitiate, alſo if the leaſe be forfeited to the Queen for not repairing, then the Queen ſhould have a title before the leaſe made to the contractors, under which the Plaintiffe claims, and that not being found by office, the contractors ſhall have no benefit thereof, and as to the caſes <hi>9. H. 6.</hi> and <hi>Torringtons</hi> caſe cited <hi>Cook lib. 1.

<list>
                           <item>Firſt, if the Fee-ſimple in this caſe by the letter or meaning of the Statute be given to the Crown, for the leaſe of <hi>99.</hi> years is agreed to be given.</item>
                           <item>Secondly, if there be ſuch an imployment of this land as the Statute requireth, admitting the leaſe was not given.</item>
                           <item>Thirdly, if the livery upon the Queens Leſſee for years be good: and I hold that the Fee is not given to the Queen.</item>
                        </list> Secondly, the land is not imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c. admitting that it was given. Thirdly, that the Feofment here is not good; and as to the caſe at Bar the Feoffees may enter: I doubt not of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not any thing found, but that it was imployed to the uſes intended for <hi>99.</hi> years. Secondly, if it were not imployed according to the condition, after <hi>1. Ed. 6.</hi> yet they cannot enter, for themſelves were parties to the Art which did prohibit it, as <hi>34. H. 8. Dyer 52.</hi> the Queen gives licence, that <hi>Belmelt</hi> ſhall be tranſported notwithſtanding any Statute made, or to be made, if after it be prohibited, the licence is determined, becauſe the Patentee himſelf was a partie to ſuch Statutes. Secondly, it is ſaid in <hi>Addams</hi> and <hi>Lamberts</hi> caſe, that a ſuperſtitious deviſe or other eſtate upon condition is within the Statute, becauſe the Patentee was partie thereunto. Thirdly, it is ſaid in the ſaid caſe, that a ſuperſtitious deviſe or other eſtate upon condition is within the Statute, becauſe it is penal, and compulſorie for the maintenance of a thing prohibited by the Law, and alſo there it is ſaid, that there is a proviſo towards the end of that Act, that it ſhall not be Lawful by reaſon of any remainder or condition for any man to claim any lands, &amp;c. for the not doing, or finding of any ſuch Prieſt: as to the other point which was moved at Bar, I hold that the uſe doth not ariſe upon the words ſubſequent, and if they do not re-enter, that then the land ſhall go to the uſe of the four Feoffees, to the intent aforeſaid, is not a miſ-ordering nor an imployment. Secondly, theſe words to the intent, do not raiſe any uſe, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a confidence and truſt repoſed in the Feoffees. <hi>Doctor</hi> and Student <hi>94.</hi> for the firſt point therefore he held, that there is no ſuperſtitious gift of the Fee-ſimple, and if there were, it is not imployed &amp;c. and therefore it is not given by the Statute of <hi>1. Ed. 6.</hi> to the Queen: and touching that we are to conſider the Statute, Indenture, and the Schedule, and there is not a word, that after <hi>99.</hi> years the land ſhall finde a Prieſt, but the money, and the land is not given, but the money, as in the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe <hi>22. Eliz. Dyer 368.</hi> if land be given to finde a Prieſt with part of the profits thereof, thoſe profits are only given to the King by this Statute, and not the land, but that belongs to the Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: alſo the Schedule is, if then it may be lawful, and therefore if it were not then lawful, the money is not given, and it is like to the caſe, where I make a leaſe for <hi>21.</hi> years, if I do allow of it before <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and before <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> do not allow of it, this is a void leaſe, and ſo if I give land to the uſe of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> School, if the Dean will enter into a Recognizance, &amp;c. and if he will not enter into a Recognizance, it is no gift, like to the caſe <hi>15, H. 7.</hi> a grant of Annuitie if ſuch a thing be done, &amp;c. ſecondly, as to the imployment, the leaſe is only found to be imployed, and the imployment of the leaſe is no imployment of the Fee, which was not given until the Term was expired, and if the gift be not ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97330:60"/>the imployment ought not to be ſuperſtitious; and yet as it is ſaid in <hi>Adams</hi> caſe, there ought to be an imployment to intitle the Queen, as the caſe there is, if one gives the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> to ſuperſtitious uſes, the Queen ſhall have the lands out of the hands of the Feoffee, and if land be given to finde a Prieſt in the Church of <hi>D.</hi> for <hi>20</hi> years, and after to finde one in <hi>S.</hi> for <hi>21.</hi> years, and before the expiration of the firſt Term, the Statute is made, it ſeems the Queen ſhall have only the firſt Term, becauſe there is no imployment of the ſecond Term within the Statute, <hi>5. Ed. 4.20.15. Ed. 3. Execu. 63.</hi> I agree thoſe caſes, for land or rent iſſue from a ſeiſin <hi>30. Ed. 3.12.</hi> in a <hi>quare impedit 5. Ed. 6. Benlowes,</hi> a deviſe to <hi>8.</hi> to the uſes and intent, that the Feoffees with the profits ſhall finde a Prieſt, whilſt the Law of this Realm will ſuffer it, and if the Law will not ſuffer it, then to the uſe of three of the pooreſt of the Pariſhes adjoyning, by all the Iudges this is not within the Statute; and as to the laſt point it ſeems, that the Feofment is good, and the intereſt of the Queen is no impediment, which if it be not then there is no queſtion, as <hi>Dyer 20. Eliz. 363.</hi> Tenant in tail makes a feofment, the ſervants of the Leſſee for years being upon the land and livery is made, and after the Leſſee for years agrees ſaving his Term, this is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance <hi>14. Ed. 4.2, 3.</hi> and <hi>4. Ph. et M. Dyer 139.</hi> poſſeſſion ſhall not be gained from the Queen, but by matter of Record <hi>4. Aſſiſes 5.21. Aſſiſes 2.8. H. 4.16.1. H. 7.</hi> no livery upon the Kings poſſeſſion, it may be deviſed by the heir, or conveyed by bargain and ſale, or by fine from him; and the Kings eſtate in reverſion doth not priviledge the eſtate in poſſeſſion, as it is <hi>23. Ed. 3.7.</hi> a diſſeiſor conveys land to the Queen who grants for life, and the diſſeiſee ſhall have a writ of entrie againſt the Queens Leſſee for life, by the opinion of <hi>Thorp, Cook lib. 4.55.</hi> a diſſeiſor makes a leaſe for life, the remainder to the King, a recovery of the land againſt Tenant for life will defeat the Kings remainder, <hi>7. Rich. 2.</hi> aide of the King <hi>61.</hi> Tenant in tail grants the land to the King with warranty, and the King makes a leaſe for life, if the iſſue recover in a <hi>Formedon</hi> the Kings eſtate is defeated; and I was of Councel in the Court of wards, in a caſe which was <hi>Paſch. 43. Eliz.</hi> betwixt <hi>Chackſton</hi> and <hi>Starkey,</hi> for the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the heir of <hi>Clifford,</hi> and it was this, the Ward at full age tendred his live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and had ſix moneths to ſue it, and within the ſix moneths made a Feofment, and after died before livery ſued, in this caſe the livery and ſeiſin was void, and it is all one as if no tender had been made, for the Queens poſſeſſion was privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; the ſecond point was, that one being in Ward to the King, had a rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Fee expectant upon an eſtate for life, and before livery ſued made a Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Fee, this makes a diſcontinuance of the reverſion, notwithſtanding the Kings intereſt, which he had in reverſion for the Wardſhip, which caſe is like to the caſe above mentioned of a leaſe for years, and alſo it was there ſaid, that if Tenant for life be, the remainder to the King for years, the remainder to another in Fee, and the Tenant for life makes a Feofment in Fee, this drawes the Kings remainder out of him, and ſo he held, that here is no gift. Secondly, that here is no imployment, and ſo the Feofment is made good. <hi>Altham</hi> ſecond Baron <hi>contra,</hi> I will conſider only two points. Firſt, if it be a gift for years or for ever, and I ſay, that it is a gift for ever, for here is no intent in the Donor to determine the ſuperſtitious uſe, becauſe he doth not limit any other uſe to which it ſhould revert, but only that the Prieſt ſhould be maintained for ever, and as that which hath been ſaid, that it was not imployed, he anſwereth that out of the Book of <hi>22. Aſſiſes 52.</hi> where <hi>12.</hi> d. is reſerved for three years, and after <hi>100.</hi> s. ſeiſin of <hi>12.</hi> d. is ſeiſin of the <hi>100.</hi> s. becauſe it is iſſuing out of the freehold, as the caſe is in <hi>Littleton</hi> in the Chapter of Atturnement, Tenant for life, the remainder in Fee, the Lord ſhall not avow upon the remainder, but ſhall have it by way of Eſcheat, for all the eſtates together are holden of the Lord, but if land be given to finde a Prieſt in <hi>D.</hi> and one is maintained in <hi>S.</hi> this is a miſ-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; but in our caſe I conceive, that the Feoffees have power to diſpoſe the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97330:61"/>land, as to them ſeems beſt, and therefore it is uncertain, and then given to the King as it was in <hi>Dales</hi> caſe, land was given to the intent, that a Prieſt ſhould be maintained as <hi>I. S.</hi> and <hi>I. D.</hi> thought fit, ſo that he had not leſs then <hi>8.</hi> marks yearly, the King ſhall have all, for the Feoffees may give all to the Prieſt if they pleaſe, and in <hi>Turners</hi> caſe, land was deviſed to a Prieſt, and divers poor men, all is given to the King by the ſuperſtitious imployment, and as to the words, (if by the Law it may be) they are idle, for <hi>id poſſumus quod de Jure poſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and therefore <hi>9. Ed. 6.</hi> an office was given to one if he were able to exerciſe it, theſe words are idle, for the Law ſaith, that he ſhall not have it, if he be not able to execute it, <hi>30. Ed. 3.8.</hi> a gift to two and to the longer liver of them, that the Survivor ſhall have it, are idle words, <hi>10. H. 7.</hi> a Condition that &amp;c. and here it the condition had been until an Act of Parliament prohibit it, they are Idle words, for if land be given to <hi>I. S.</hi> and his heirs, upon condition, that if he die without heirs &amp;c. this is a void condition and Repugnant to Law. Laſtly, I hold the feofment good by way of Admittance, and that the livery takes effect, notwithſtanding the Queens intereſt <hi>4. H. 6.19.</hi> the Kings Tenant for life is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſed, he ſhall have an Aſſiſe, and yet there is no intruſion upon the King <hi>17. H. 7.6.</hi> the Kings Leſſee makes a feofment, the King enters, and ſo he held, that the judgement ſhould he given for the Defendant. <hi>Snig</hi> Baron argued much to the ſame intent, that <hi>Bromley</hi> had done, and that the Schedule is ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, that nothing is given after the <hi>99.</hi> years, and that a ſpirit of Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on forwarned him of the alteration, and he agreed the Feofment to be good with this difference, where the King is in poſſeſſion actually, and where the Reverſion is in the King, and the book of <hi>2 H. 4.9.</hi> that none ſhall enter upon the Kings Farmor is to be underſtood of the Kings under Tenants, and not of his Leſſees. <hi>Tanfield</hi> chief Baron ſaid, that neither by the intent of the Statute, nor of the parties, the fee is given to the Queen, but it is apparant, that during the <hi>99.</hi> years, the parties intent is in ſuſpence for fear of alteration, and that they would ſee the difference of the times, and leave the diſpoſing thereof to his Feoffees, and if they had ſold the land, and with the money maintained a Prieſt, as many ſtocks of money have uſed to do, without doubt it had been forfeited to the King, and not the land; and it would be in vain to ſpeak of an Amortization, if it be for a ſtipendary Prieſt only, for this would not be neceſſary to have a foundation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated, and to make an Amortization for ſuch a Prieſt, and therefore it ſeems to him, that there is no determination of his will after the <hi>99.</hi> years, but that all is left to the determination and diſpoſition of the feoffees who then ſhould be, and after the intent of the Statute, which was penned by <hi>Hales</hi> Iuſtice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas. I obſerve four words, given, appointed, limited, and aſſigned, and I do not conceive, that our caſe is within the compaſs of any of them, for as I ſaid before, it is in ſuſpence until the end of <hi>99.</hi> years, and the parties who ſhould have the intereſt are not known untill the time come, nor the eſtate ſetled until that time, but if it had been conveyed to ſuperſtitious uſes after, it had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Queen, notwithſtanding the conveyance had not been ſufficient, if he who did convey had power in reſpect of the abilitie of his perſon, and the eſtate in him, and therefore <hi>Paſch. 22. Eliz.</hi> the caſe was this, Sir <hi>William Say,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Statute of <hi>32. H. 8.</hi> of Wills was ſeiſed of lands in fee not deviſable, and before the ſaid Statute he deviſed it to finde a Prieſt, and notwithſtanding that the deviſe was not good, yet it was adjudged, that the land was given to the Queen by <hi>1. Ed. 6.</hi> but if it were a feme covert, or an infant, who are diſabled in Law, or a Tenant in tail, who is diſabled in reſpect of his eſtate, there it had not been given to the Queeen, but in all caſes there ought to be an aſſignment, or otherwiſe nothing is given; and there is a difference where one grants land to the intent with the profits thereof to finde a Prieſt, there all the land is given to the Queen, and where he grants a rent for the maintenance of a Prieſt, for there the King ſhall have but the Rent;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97330:61"/>and he ſaid, that the Caſe cited, <hi>5. Ed. 6. Benlos,</hi> is good Law, and as to that which hath been ſaid: That becauſe the power of the Feoffees is uncertain, it ſhould be given to the Queen, true it is where the power is uncertain to beſtow the profits, but if their power be certain, it is otherwiſe, and as to the imployment there is none, becauſe there is no gift, but the imployment of the particular eſtate is an imployment of the Remainder, and a ſmall thing will make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. <hi>James caſe</hi> was of the Greyhound in <hi>Fleetſtreet</hi> which was given to finde a Prieſt, and the White Horſe for the maintenance of another, and the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fees of the White-horſe, maintained the Prieſt of the Greyhound; and <hi>è conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sò,</hi> and this was ruled to be an imployment, for it was whereby, or wherewith a Prieſt was maintained, although it was not whereof, and <hi>Mich. 21. Eliz.</hi> the Kings head in <hi>Breadſtreet,</hi> now <hi>Fiſhſtreet</hi> was given to finde a Prieſt, and a rent-charge granted in performance of the Will, and this was adjudged an imployment of the houſe, and ſo where the aſſignment is good, a ſmall thing will make an imployment. And it ſeems that the Liverie is good, and as to that, that no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very can be made without ouſting of the Leſſor, and by his conſent, and therefore <hi>9. Eliz.</hi> It is ruled, that a Feoffement with a Letter of Atturney to the Leſſee to make livery is good, and no ſurrender, and <hi>Eides and Knotsfords caſe, 41. Eliz.</hi> Leſſee for years, remainder for life, remainder in fee, he in remainder in fee makes a Feoffement to the Leſſee for years, and makes Livery, and it was adjudged a good Feoffement, becauſe it was not a ſurrender, in reſpect of the meane eſtate for life, and no ouſter nor conſent will ſerve, for then it would be a diſſeiſin, which cannot be upon the poſſeſſion of the Leſſee for years, for his poſſeſſion is alſo of him in the remainder for life, and I put theſe Caſes, that there ought to be a conſent or ouſter, but I agree that the Queens poſſeſſion cannot be defeated by entry or ouſter, as it is <hi>4. Mar. Dyer 139.8. Aſſ. 21.18. H. 8.16.</hi> But the Kings Ward may make an eſtate, <hi>1. H. 7.</hi> But if the King be not in poſſeſſion, but a remainder only in him, and the Leſſor makes a Feoffement, rendring <hi>12.</hi> d. rent, this eſtate in the King doth not priviledge any other in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſo judgement was given for the Plaintiff againſt the opinion of <hi>Altham.</hi>

                     <p>IN <hi>22. Eliz. York</hi> recovered by Indicement in the Kings Bench againſt <hi>Allen</hi> upon an Aſſumpſit, <hi>York</hi> being thus intereſſed of the debt, after that is in <hi>May, 26. Eliz.</hi> was outlawed upon a mean Proces at the ſuit of <hi>I. S.</hi> and in the ſame year and moneth was outlawed after judgement at the ſuit of the ſame <hi>I. S.</hi> and after a generall pardon came <hi>27. Eliz.</hi> in which pardon, after the pardon of all contempts for outlawrie, there are words alſo purporting a Grant, bounty, and liberality, whereby the Queen granted all montes forfeited, or come unto her hands, by reaſon of any ſuch outlawry, with other words in the ſame pardon, and <hi>Proviſoes</hi> therein contained, neceſſary to be obſerved: And after in <hi>28. El. York</hi> was outlawed again after judgement at the ſuit of <hi>I. S.</hi> and then <hi>Yorke</hi> died, but he lived a full year after the pardon, <hi>27. Eliz.</hi> and did not ſue any <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt the party, at whoſe ſuit he was outlawed after Iudgement; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Yorke</hi> another pardon came, <hi>29. Eliz.</hi> to the ſame effect with the pardon in <hi>27.</hi> And after the Queen grants this debt to <hi>Anger</hi> for the benefit of Mrs <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> who was the Wife of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and <hi>Anger ſued</hi> in the Queens name to have an extent, out of this Court againſt <hi>Allen,</hi> who was the party againſt whom Iudgement was given, and all this was drawn into a Caſe, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Barons of the Exchequer to conſider upon, <hi>viz.</hi> If execution may be ſued in the Queens name againſt <hi>Allen,</hi> and this caſe was argued at the Barre at which I was preſent; And now it was argued at the Bench by <hi>Bromley</hi> Puiſne Baron, and concluded that <hi>Anger</hi> may well ſue execution in the Queens name,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97330:62"/>but he had almoſt made an end of his Argument before I came into the Court, and three points ſeemed to be conſidered of in the Caſe. The <hi>1.</hi> was unanimouſly reſolved, and agreed by all the Barons, that either of the pardons will advantage <hi>Allen,</hi> who was debtor to the party outlawed, for although that the words of the pardon, unport a pardon of all debts and ſums of money accrued to the Queen by reaſon of the outlawry, yet comparing all the parts of the pardons together, it will plainly appear, that the intent of the pardon was only for the advantage of him, who had committed the forfeiture by the contempt, and extends only to him by way of reſtitution; And another conſtruction would be repugnant to all the Cauſes contained in the Act; By <hi>Tanfield,</hi> as a Will ought to receive conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by due conſideration of the intention of the Teſtator collected out of all the parts thereof, ſo the meaning of an Act of Parliament ought to be expounded by an examination of the intention of the makers thereof, collected out of all the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thes therein, ſo that there be no repugnancy, but a concordancy in all the parts thereof, and therefore if a man by will deviſe Bacre to <hi>A.</hi> and his heirs, and by another cauſe in the ſame Will he deviſes <hi>B</hi> acre to <hi>B.</hi> and his aſſignes, it ſhall not be void in any part, inſomuch that if both had been placed together, <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> ſhould be Ioyntenants, and therefore the Law will make ſuch a conſtruction, and ſo if a man deviſe <hi>B.</hi> acre to <hi>A.</hi> and after he deviſes a Rent out of it to another, both ſhall ſtand: <hi>Brett</hi> and <hi>Rigdens</hi> caſe, <hi>Plowden,</hi> Alſo this Debt was due by <hi>Allen; 2.</hi> It was reſolved by <hi>Tanfield</hi> and <hi>Bromley,</hi> that <hi>Yorke</hi> ſhould take no advantage by the Pardon in <hi>27. Eliz.</hi> to have his goods reſtored, which were forfeited by the outlawry after judgement, for by them all the Statute for the pardon of the outlawry after judgement was penued in ſuch a form, as it is but conditionall, for it is in effect provided, that the pardon ſhall not extend to the party outlawed after judgement untill he ſhall pay or agree with the party, at whoſe ſuit he was outlawed, and this payment ought to be in the Court, or in ſuch manner that the Court may be ſatisfied by the ſuing of a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and an acknowledgement of the party at whoſe ſuit, &amp;c. for a bare payment in the Country is not ſufficient; But when the party outlawed hath once lawfully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the party, at whoſe ſuit he was outlawed, then the pardon will relate <hi>ab initio</hi> to avoid all intervenient matters, if the ſatisfaction be made in convenient time, and therefore if the King had granted the goods forfeited by outlawry after judgment meane between the pardon, and the ſuing of the <hi>Scire facias,</hi> yet if the party outlawed ſue this <hi>Scire facias</hi> within convenient time, the pardon ſhall have ſuch relation as it ſhall defeat the grant of the goods, and therefore <hi>Tanfield</hi> compared the words in the pardon of the outlawry after judgement to the words in the Statute of <hi>27. H. 8.</hi> of intolments, for there it is provided, that nothing ſhall paſſe by bargaine and Sale, except the Deed be inrolled within ſix moneths after, but if it be not inrolled, otherwiſe it is.</p>

B.</hi> and ſhews the matter as above, and upon that the Kings Atturney demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97330:62"/>
                        <hi>Bromley</hi> and <hi>Altham</hi> Barons, that the Declaration of the uſes made by the third Indenture was good, and he having power by the firſt to declare new uſes, may declare them with power of Revocation, for it is not meerly a power, but conjoyned with an intereſt, and therefore may be executed with a power of Revocation, and then when he by the third Indenture revokes the former uſes, now it is as if new uſes had been declared, and then he may declare uſes at any time after the Fine, as it appears by <hi>4. Mar. Dyer 136.</hi> and <hi>Coke lib. 9. Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> caſe, and in this caſe they did rely upon <hi>Diggs caſe Cooke lib. 1.</hi> where it is ſaid, that upon ſuch a Power, he can revoke but once, for that part, unleſſe he had a new power of Revocation of Vſes newly to be limited, whereby it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that if he had a new power to appoint new uſes, he may revoke them alſo. <hi>Snig</hi> Baron to the contrary, and ſaid, that he had not power to declare <hi>3.</hi> ſeverall uſes, by the firſt contract, which ought to Authoriſe all the Declarations upon that Fine, and then the Revocation by the third Indenture is good, and the limitation void, and then it ſhall be to the uſe of <hi>R. B.</hi> and his heirs, and ſo by the death of <hi>R. B.</hi> it doth deſcend to <hi>T. B.</hi> the Recuſant, and alſo he ſaid, that ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture, to declare uſes upon uſes, was never made, and it would be miſchievous to declare infinite uſes upon uſes. <hi>Tanfield</hi> held, that the uſes in the ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture ſtand unrevoked, and the new uſes in the third Indenture are void, and then <hi>H. B.</hi> ought to have the Land again out of the Kings hands. The power in the ſecond Indenture is, that he may revoke and limit new uſes, and that the Fine ſhall be to thoſe new uſes, and no others: and then if there be a Revocation, and no punctuall limitation, he had not purſued his Authority, for he ought to revoke and limit, and he cannot doe the one without the other: Alſo he ſaid, that after ſuch Revocation and limitation, the fine ſhall be to ſuch new uſes and no other, then if there be no new uſes well limited in the third Indenture, the former uſes ſhall ſtand void.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nota,</hi> it ſeemeth that if a man make a Feoffement and declare uſes, and reſerve a power to revoke them, without ſaying moe, he cannot revoke them, and limit new, for the uſe of the Fine being once declared by the Indenture, no other uſe can be averred or declared which is not warranted thereby, for he cannot declare the fine to be to new uſes, when it was once declared before, <hi>Cook lib. 2.76.</hi> That no other uſe can be averred, then that in the conveyauce, <hi>Cooke lib. 9, 10, 11.</hi> Although that the firſt uſes are determined, as if a man declare the uſe of a Fine, to be to one and his Heires upon condition, that he ſhall pay <hi>40.</hi> l. &amp;c. or untill he do ſuch an Act, if the firſt uſe be determined, the Fine cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe declared to be to new uſes; And therefore it ſeemes that all the uſes which ſhall riſe out of the Fine, ought to ſpring from the firſt Indenture, which teſtifieth the certain intention of the parties in the leaving thereof, and then in the Caſe above, the ſecond Indenture and the limitation of new uſes thereby, are well war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the firſt Indenture, and in reſpect that this is not a naked power only, I conceive that they may be upon condition, or upon a power of Revocation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine them; But the power to limit the third uſes by a third indenture after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the ſecond uſes in the ſecond indenture, hath not any Warrant from the firſt Indenture, and without ſuch Warrant, there can be no Declaration of ſuch new uſes, which were not declared or authoriſed by the firſt Indenture, which <hi>Note,</hi> for it ſeems to be good Law.</p>
